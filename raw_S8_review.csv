5,"I've had the phone for nearly a month now and I love it. I probably didn't need to upgrade, as my Galaxy S5 was perfectly functional although seemed to be running slower. I'm not much of a phone-tographer, but the cameras seem to be a big improvement over the S5. Camera functions too, feel more intuitive and quicker. Im not a huge fan of the curved edges. Aside from allowing more comfort for the hand, the edge feels more like a gimmick than anything. It essentially disappears once the phone is in a case, which is almost a necessity considering the price. I understand some might find it annoying that the fingerprint sensor is now on the back of the phone, but I haven't yet gotten onboard with biosecurity technology. I still like my 4 digit PIN, so I can't speak to the iris scanner or facial recognition either. I was worried about the absence of a tactile home button, but it hasn't been an issue. Bixby, like biosecurity, is something I haven't found a use for yet. It's exclusive button is very close to the volume down button, which can be mildly aggravating if you are relying on touch alone to minimize sound. Speaking of sound, the speaker is now on the bottom of the phone as opposed to the back. As someone who watches/listens to a good deal of media on my phone, I find this change from my S5 a great improvement. As for battery life, I've been extremely satisfied so far. I was very happy with my S5's battery life and I find that my S8 lasts considerably longer. I am slightly nervous about not having access to my battery, though. Over the two and a half years I used my S5 I did have to remove the battery a handful of times to reset the phone due to unresponsiveness or glitches. Another improvement over the S5 is lack of a plastic back, which made that phone feel cheap. Conversely, the higher end metal and glass back of this phone make it feel incredibly fragile. It's too bad that something so sleek and well-designed requires a case to keep it from scratches, scuffs and cracks. The advertised ""infinity screen is non-existent with the addition of even the slimmest case. Lastly, I really like the included headphones in comparison to those of the S5. They are a little more substantial in the ear, keeping them from popping out and also allowing a good deal of noise-cancellation. The cord feels to be made of a sturdy metal mesh that comes off as rugged and long-lasting."
5,"Very hard to change from IPhone 6 because we intended on waiting for IPhone 8. Took the plunge and very pleased with S8, very fast, simple and can't say we will be going back to iphone."
5,"Switched from an LG G5
The phone is very fast and so far my battery is lasting longer than a day with a lot of use. I left the screen on 1080 which still looks great. As someone else pointed out, screen protectors are a pain and not just the zagg one. None of them seem to fit the slight curve. Phone is fast and looks amazing"
5,"Camera is great, phone and apps are easy to work with, loving it better than my iPhone 6S."
5,Love this phone and all that it can Do! Always buy our phones from best buy. They take great care of their customers.
4,"So I was really excited to get this phone. It looks great, it's fast, the call clarity is superb, the screen size is amazing, and the camera is top notch. BUT, the screen has already cracked. The phone has not been dropped yet, and I'd like to think I take good care of it. I noticed a small spec in the screen one afternoon, and it got worse over the next few days, and now it runs up an down the entire screen. I honestly have no idea what I did to make this happen. I guess now I am stuck with it for 24 more months. Luckily, none of the functionality seems lost, so I am still enjoying it for the most part."
5,"THIS phone is awesome no matter what way you put it. The design is freakin' beautiful! Awesome screen, thin, it's fast, and everything yoou want in a smartphone. Well worth the money."
5,"Very nice phone. It's the latest flagship phone from Samsung and it does not disappoint. The screen is beautiful, the performance is snappy. The USB-C port is convenience, and, importantly to me, the new Samsung S8/S8+ support video-out via the USB-C port. You need to buy a USB-C to HDMI adapter separately, though."
5,"I decided the time and price were right to upgrade from my Galaxy S5, which I had for about three years, to the S8 and overall I am pleased with it.

Compared to the S5 the S8 is thinner, narrower, and made of slick/shiny guerrilla glass. This might be good for smaller hands to hold but for me this phone required a case for better grip. So after a week of use I decided to purchase the Urban Armor Gear Monarch case which provides the right amount of width and grip as well protection and still fits in my pocket without being bulky.

The picture is bright and clear, even on the lowest setting. The external speaker at the bottom of the phone sounds surprisingly good, too. You just have to remember not to keep your hand over it or you'll muffle the sound. Of course you could also use the enclosed earbuds provided by AKG or your own as this phone has a headphone jack. The calls I've made so far have come in loud and clear. 

I use the retina scan to unlock the phone and it works very well so far. Also, I plan to get the fast charge pad, but for now I'm using the fast charge cord the it came with. 

Just a few suggestions for Best Buy:
1. Have a few sample cases at the display table so customers can compare the feel of the phone both with and without a case. 
2. I found out my Best Buy credit card is not supported on Samsung Pay or Android Pay, even though it has the Citi logo. I called the Samsung Pay help desk and I was told the card was not supported because it was issued by Best Buy rather than Citi. So I am hoping Best Buy can lobby for all its credit card members to get the Best Buy credit card included with Samsung Pay and Android Pay. I know I would use that app."
3,"As always, the Galaxy S8 is a step forward for mobile technology, though some of the choices they made are rather bizarre. What I do admire is the new Super AMOLED display, which works well in almost any lighting situation without manually adjusting your brightness. I also like the other typical things, like external memory, good screen size, and 4K resolution.

Unfortunately, as I mentioned previously, there are a few things I'm not totally comfortable with. For Instance, the Edge Screen has been a nuisance while attempting to type until I had to turn it off. The Bixby commands are way too easy to trigger. For example, if you're trying to adjust the volume of something, your finger slips and you turn Bixby on. Swipe left on your home screen too much, Bixby turns on. Don't get me wrong, I like Bixby, I just wish that it wasn't so intrusive.

Finally, for one of my biggest gripes, they changed the aspect ratio of the phone. You see, instead of expanding in both dimensions, the Galaxy S8 decided to expand only vertically. While this means that it can better fit in places like cup holders or pants pockets, it also means that they changed the aspect ratio to 18:9. I wouldn't have as much of an issue with this if more things were integrated with that. A lot of apps are stuck in 16:9, and changing that could break the application. This means that 11% of the screen is wasted on black space. This is something I hope they go back on with the Galaxy S9.

Overall, I think that the Galaxy S8 is just okay, which is bad for a Samsung."
5,"Long time iPhone user switching to the far superior galaxy s8. Battery life is great even in high performance mode, super fast charging. I don't feel like I have to ration my battery or make my phone a wall phone."
5,"When Samsung announced the coral blue color, my wife just had to have it. What a great upgrade for the S6...superfast, gorgeous screen, wireless charging is awesome, camera head and shoulders above S6...I may get the S8+ for myself!"
5,"I have always been an iPhone person. Whenever I've strayed away from the iPhone, I've always gone back to it after a couple weeks. But not this time! The Samsung Galaxy S8 is awesome. Coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, it took a little while to get used to the narrowness of the S8, but the screen size is actually slightly bigger diagonally than the iPhone Plus's, so I didn't feel the need to get the S8+. The size of this phone is perfect - it fits so much better in pockets, purses, etc., than the iPhone 6 Plus. 
The camera on the S8 is stunning. The colors are true, the depth and clarity are on point, and with the improvements Samsung has made to the front-facing camera, you don't end up looking all distorted like on previous Galaxy models.
The S8 is fast, I'm not experiencing any lag when quickly switching between apps or playing games. The battery is decent, but the iPhone 6 Plus battery was better. Although, it is nice to have a couple different power-saving modes on the S8.
Being able to customize everything on the S8 is a really great, and so is being able to have all kinds of widgets. Since the last time I had an Android phone (3 or 4 years ago), there have been so many improvements made to the Play Store. Apps for Apple and Android seem to basically be the same now, which is great. Also, I feel that I am able to make my phone more secure with Android as opposed to Apple. 
All in all, I'm happy with the switch I made to the S8 from the iPhone :)"
5,"Phone is beautiful, sleek, and even some of the typical bloatware is uninstallable. The S8 so far is fabulous with plenty of awesome new features/tweaks. That being said.....Below is a link to the ""Top of the line"" screen protector that Best Buy stocks for the S8. DO NOT BUY THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR. Read the reviews, you won't regret it.

5,"I have enjoyed using this phone so much that I feel the need to write one of my first online reviews.

My last two phones were the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. I enjoyed both very much; the only thing i disliked about either was the battery life. Neither of these phones lasted me a full days use, which often left me without a phone late at night. This was a huge issue when I was out late and needed uber or to contact friends, and was something I wanted to avoid with my next phone purchase. I loved iOS, and my iPhone six was still working fine minus the awful battery life. 

After reading some reviews on the iPhone 7, i decided to look into android phones due to the mediocre battery reviews.

The s8 had good reviews for battery life, although not the best for Verizon models (moto z play), but it had the best reviews for almost everything else, which swayed me. Best buy also had a deal going on when i purchased it that made it the same price per month as the moto z2 play. That made the decision to buy it much easier. 

The user interface is easy to use and highly customizable, the screen is amazing, it comes with 64 gigs of storage (my last phone had 16 so this was huge for me) and the battery life is incredible! I've tried it on the two main battery settings, high and mid, and both lasted me at least a full day. My first day with high use and heavy downloading on full power lasted me from 8a-1a with over 20% left. On mid battery saver mode, it had over half the battery left. I've ended up around 40% on full power since that first day. All days referenced were around 17 hours. I use my phone pretty heavily, and see the biggest drops on apps like reddit, groupme, and youtube. The phone also charges very quickly.

I never could play games on my last two phones due to storage. I've downloaded a few, including final fantasy 9, and all run very smoothly. It's kind of blowing my mind that one of my favorite playstation games can run so well on a phone. 

The edge to edge display is as advertised; it's the first thing that draws you in in-store. The pressure sensitive home button is great and I've had no issues even when using a glass screen protector. The finger print sensor is also located in a place that's apparently bothering many users, but I have a case that makes it very easy to feel where it is, so I have no complaints. I went with the clear otterbox symmetry because I liked the way the orchid gray back of the phone looks. 

I wouldn't recommend purchasing one of the $50 tempered glass screen protectors they sell due to the price. I love glass protectors because I'm accident prone, and I've been using a $6 protector from amazon. Tempered glass protectors are all getting panned online, but I've had no issues. I'd be really nervous using this phone without the extra protection. 

In regards to my purchasing experience, Best Buy was great! I had only upgraded phones in Verizon stores since my first phone in high school, so going to Best Buy made me slightly wary. The associates were all incredibly helpful and not pushy at all. They actually talked me out of purchases. I was heavily considering the s8+ for the extra battery and I'm very glad I passed. It was way too big in my hands, and it wouldn't have been worth an extra hour or two of battery life I wouldn't end up needing. I was able to easily add the phone on to my monthly plan, just like at Verizon, only at half the cost. 

Overall, I can't imagine there's a better phone out right now. It's the most unique and fun user experience I've had since my first smart phone."
4,"This was an upgrade from S4. The transfer of contacts done in the store was incomplete, but an app I found easily transferred all contacts from S4 to S8. The camera has some cool features. Notification sounds are all different than previous phone, so there is a learning curve. Love the blue color!"
5,I wasn't planning on upgrading but the price at BB was so great I couldn't help myself. It has been a great decision as I had an S7 and this phone has an awesome battery and so fast...love it.
4,I really enjoy the phone. I wish there was an option for no edge screen. I cracked the screen in the first two weeks. Thank goodness it still works because geek squad insurance says I can't get a replacement yet. One month so far with a shattered screen being held together with a screen protector.
5,"Great phone with a super b camera. Amazing display, 5.8 but you will have no problem at all using it with one hand. Very recommended."
1,"I had to switch to Verizon for provider due to my location which meant i had to buy a ""verizon"" phone. given the sale price I opted for the new S8. I have had nothing but problems from day 1. From the pop up ads occurring all day and all night to the muffled voice. Complaints that I sound garbled and can't be understood. I went back to Best buy on numerous occasions as well as the verizon store. I met with the Samsung rep and no one could fix the problems. Verizon eventually told to return again t best buy that I must have faulty phone. Met with the manager who at this point knew the issues I was having since I had been there multiple times in 2weeks I had the phone, however, I arrived on the 15th day after I purchased the phone. I was told there was nothing that could be done because returns were allowed only up to day 14. Despite the fact I had my receipt and had been there trying to get the phone fixed numerous times. It should have been replaced 2 days after I purchased it when I went back to Best buy the first time. I now have a reconditioned S8 phone that Verizon sent to me as I had to send the new one back to Verizon.Best Buy did nothing about this issue. I am now still on the payment plan for a brand new phone despite the fact I have a reconditioned one. I still have issues with not being understood, sounded muffled and garbled. Periodically I am not able to hear the person on the other end or their is a few second delay so we end up speaking over each other. I wish I Never got this phone."
5,"I have always owned an Android phone for as long as I can remember. I tried the Apple IPhone 7 and I did try to give the phone a chance but it wasn't for me. 
Went back to the Galaxy S8 and I couldn't be happier. I am on my phone a lot so I love how long the battery stays charged."
4,The Galaxy S8 is a beautiful phone with a few flaws that consumers should be made aware of. The fingerprint sensor is not in the ideal location however it works great for accessing the notification menu. The curved glass also causes screen protectors to not it here to the surface very well. Also the big-selling point is Bixby but it is not functioning as promised.
5,"This phone is easy to use looks sleek has an amazing screen and is several times more powerful than Apples new $1000 phone. Apple will probably have this tech on the market in about 5 years, and charge $1500 for it, or you could get all that now at a fraction of the price!"
5,"Phone is easy to use, great camera, light in weight,."
5,These continue to be the best phone with great features that won't arrive on the iPhone for two versions.
5,Long battery life and fast need a case slippery in hands
5,"This is my 3rd phone from the Galaxy line (S3 and S6 were my 1st and 2nd) and even though the first two were perfectly fine and performed well this one far out does them.
It's taking me some getting used to not having an actual physical home button to get to the home screen and the default location of the Chrome shortcut button happens to be exactly where my apps button is on my S6. These aren't negatives at all.
The edge seems fine although I really haven't looked at it much yet.
The Bixby button/function is well placed but haven't looked at it much yet either.
The Best Buy employee was great.
The Samsung representative in the Best Buy store was great.
There are actual official Samsung Repair Centers in select Best Buy stores...I didn't know this until AFTER I purchased my phone. So while not a negative the web site could do a better job of letting people browsing Samsung devices know that there is such an option.
With that new information in mind I decided to switch my phone protection to the Geek Squad plan instead of the one offered by my carrier and hope I never need to use it but am content that I can go to a Best Buy store to take care of it.
Excellent phone.
Excellent customer service by both the Best Buy employee and the Samsung Representative.
Excellent protection plan option.
Excellent Best Buy incentive. My carrier had none except if I traded in my old phone which I didn't want to do."
4,"So far I have really liked the phone. I upgraded from the S7 and it has been a good transition. I was concerned about the phone being too bulky but its pretty much the same size other than the height. The infinity screen (the curved edges) make it hard for cases to fit just right, but at least there is a lifeproof for it. Otherwise the phone is great. It is super fast and the camera is incredible. It almost freaked me out how HD the recording is. If i were to change anything on the phone, it would be the bixby button and bixby itself. It seems like a waste of a button and space on my phone. I'd rather the button start google assistant."
5,"I will always buy samsung, Great phone!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great and good price. Everything including service was great.
5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is very stylish and sleek. I purchased this phone for $370 a week before black Friday.
4,"Great camera. Great video. Great low light performance. Lots more storage than my previous 16gb phone. I love that I can add a micro SD card. The curved screen is a gimmick that I don't find that useful. But the curved screen makes it very difficult to get a good screen protector that doesn't interfere with the touch screen, doesn't fall off, and doesn't peel up when swiping from the edge. I have had to restart it a few times when I encounter glitches that make the phone hang. Otherwise, the phone is great."
5,"I hadn't upgraded my phone since the Galaxy S4 because features such as a removable battery and even upgraded storage had been taken out and because my S4 still was working just fine even to this day. The only real reason I upgraded was because of a special deal going on with the new S8 and I figured ""why not?"" Even though those two previously mentioned features are not in the new phone, it actually hasn't impacted me like I thought I would. A much more improved battery lasts me a few days without charging and it leads me to believe it will last me quite a while down the road. Also going from 16GB storage to 64 GB storage made me not even need an extra SD card anyway. The Interface runs very smoothly and the screen quality is fantastic. It might not be worth going from the S7 one up, but if you're more than a couple models back, it's worth it."
5,"I had been hesitant to upgrade because the S7 didn't allow for adding an SD card, so I waited, and I am glad I did. The S8 is a great phone and very performant. I really like the form factor and how it sits in my hand. It was a huge jump up from my s5. I really like the new charger (USB3) and how fast it charges. I do not have any issues with this phone and I have owned it now for several months."
5,"I am not very good at using phones and all the stuff that comes with it. However, this phone is very easy to maneuver and use. Love the emoji selection"
4,I am really not an android girl i love my Apple iPhone but when i tried the Samsung it almost had me switch. If your into android phones i recommend this phone.
5,I am loving this new phone. The camera's on both front and back are exceptional. The call quality is great. I love the look and feel of this phone. The screen is just awesome. And I love all the new security features on this phone.
5,"The GS8 is a very nice, premium feeling phone with an awesome edge to edge display. The android operating system runs very smooth. The camera quality is also quite good."
4,"Phone is easy to use. Great camera, clean pictures. Applications easier to use."
4,I liked my phone and is overall smooth and sturdy. But a little knock on the curved side of the screen caused it to crack. I wish I had it cover protected on day one.
5,I got the phone on August 20th and so far so good. I really like the phone and it's durable.
5,This phone has an AMAZING camera.. takes some of the best pictures ever!! Absolutely love this phone!!
5,"My Samsung Galaxy 8 purchase exceeded my expectations. There are so many features that even after 6 months I continue to learn new things about my phone. The camera is amazing, my photo's are the best I have ever taken with a cellphone."
4,Sleek design and I love the storage capacity. The fingerprint scanner moving to the back of phone and lack of a Home button takes some getting used to.
5,"The Coral Blue color is stunning and exclusive to Best Buy! Fans of Samsung products and Android phones will not be disappointed in the quality of the phone in performance, camera imaging, and functionality. Apple users, this phone will make you want to convert!"
5,This phone does it all. It looks great with it's slick form factor. There's no lag when I use it and the camera is great. There's a ton of shortcuts with the hard buttons and everything is pretty seamless. There's nothing you can do with the hard button for Bixby being there but at least there are apps to change its use. I have no complaints. The camera is top notch.
5,"I love this phone but the aspect ratio is a little weird. When watching a movie or video with the screen in landscape orientation, there are vertical black bars on both edges of the screen. This is a minor issue but it's worth mentioning. Great Battery life and unlock features. The iris scan is really cool and works surprisingly well!"
4,"Great upgrade from my S5, which has been feeling slow & clunky! Nice slim phone, awesome screen and lots of new features."
4,"the S8 is a very good cell phone. The camera takes nice pictures and the display is sharp and clear. Accessing web pages is rapid and having many sites open at same time is no problem. My main complaint is that when a button or keyboard character displays at the edge of the screen trying to get the item to display may require several touches due to curvature of screen. The edge of screen is good for display purposes, but awkward for input."
3,This is a great phone but the curved edges are not an asset. The buttons near the edges are tricky to push due to the curve. The options for covers to protect the phone are also limited due to the curved screen and require a glass screen protector ( which makes the keys less sensitive) and a cover that does not come up around the edge of the screen to protect it in case of a fall.
5,"This phone is fast, has a huge memory and looks great with the curved edges. It takes a while to get used to the fact that there's no physical home button, but the on-screen button works just as well and if you hold that area where the button for 1-2 seconds while the screen is off, it turns on the screen just like it would with a physical home button. Great product overall!"
3,I enjoy my galaxy 8 phone but the camera is hard to work with the protective case over it. And my internet signal is worse than my galaxy 6.
5,"I read the reviews before I purchased this phone and I have to say that this is the best phone out in my opinion. I've had it for almost 2 weeks now and I'm still learning new things. The battery life is amazing on this phone! I got a body glove case but no screen protector as it's really difficult to find one that works with the curved screen and a case. The only things I hate are the curved screen, the size, and the volume. I really wish Samsung would have made a flat screen and made the screen 5'3 inches instead of the 5'8 inches because I believe that's a sweet spot, not too big and not too small. Also I wish Samsung had provided a louder speaker, maybe duel speakers at the bottom and one in the ear piece like the iPhone 7. These are minor issues and not enough to lose a star over but I just believe if these things were done it really would be the perfect phone in my opinion."
4,Still learning all the new features. No problems at this point other than the curved screen doesn't take a glass protector shield very well. Will look at a flexible plastic protector to see if it's any better.
5,"This phone is definitely way smarter than I am, I am still finding out the features, but the User Interface is great and it's a beautiful product. The only knock I'd give it is that on speaker phone mode for calls it tends to cut out."
5,"I upgraded to the S8 from the S5 with no hesitation once I knew the phone had the 835 Qualcomm chip. It was between the S8 and the Sony Xperia premium. The S8 had a slim profile and better screen to body ratio. Screen resolution was not a deal changer since it's just a phone, not a tv. Great quality phone that's fast. I have been using the face recognition with a back up pin to unlock the phone. The face recognition doesn't register as often as I'd like. To trouble shoot this, go change your picture in the unlock settings to a common position you typically gold to unlock your phone. I'd recommend playing with your picture as you'll see when the phone takes it. But overall great buy, interested in the bixby release."
5,"This product has very few noticeable changes from the S7, except now it has a curved screen. I wasn't really in favor of this feature. 
My S7 was a great phone, I assume this will be too. Time will tell."
5,It feels very sleek way better upgrade from an s6. It feels good but would recommend a case
1,"Traded in a S7 and bought S8. S7 worked perfectly with 2017 Prius. S8 only notifies car of phone calls, but not messages or email. I intend to return it. Wish I could get my old S7 back. S8 far inferior to S7 and basically unusable for me when driving. This is a known issue on Samsung user boards."
5,"The phone is amazing and sleek. It has a very ressponsive interface and a very comfortable design for 1-handed and 2-handed use. The only complaint I have is the location of the Bixby button. This is Samsung's version of Seri. The button is located right below the volume on the left side of the phone and can easily be pressed on accident, which gets annoying. 

The best buy service was great during my purchase and was handled very smoothly and in a timely manner."
5,Happy with the phones overall performance. Outperforms expectations.
4,"Beautiful, Feels nice, performs well so far: It is still new, but it is very nice and we are quite pleased with it so far. speedy, very nice display, and feels great."
5,"Nice phone. The curved screen is great for pics, but a bit of a pain to put the screen protector on. The inductive charging is great too. Great upgrade to older Galaxy models."
1,"Known fragility issues, screens and case are cracking with and without dropping and with protective cases and screen protectors. Do your research, I have always loved the Galaxy S phones but this one is different. Buyer Beware!!"
5,"Best buy had the very best deal on the Samsung 8, Ive had no issues with this phone... Highly recommend it"
5,I was on the fence between iphone and samsung. samsung clearly is better because the android allows me to customize my phone to my needs. battery life is great
4,"I have to say that this phone has been a good upgrade compared to other phones. Its not a loud phone, but its decent. I really like the display, battery life, and different features it has. Another good thing, it has not frozen yet. I am still getting used to the edge which makes it hard to find a good screen protector for it. Overall its a nice job done by Samsung and a great deal with Best Buy!"
4,Loved the phone! More features than I could handle. Phone was a little narrow for my liking coming from a S5. Display was nice and sharp. Overall the phone was really nice to use. I had it for about 10 days before I returned it. The only down side to the phone was the charging adapter. The phone does not use the standard samsung charging connection but instead you have to use a tiny adapter on all your cords. That is the only reason I gave it four out of five stars and returned it for a S7 Edge..
5,Best buy is much more helpful than the corporate version store was I'll never set foot in Verizon again
5,"I'm extremely happy with this phone. I bought it on the black Friday deal offering $350 off and I couldn't be happier. The battery life of this phone is PHENOMENAL. I am an avid phone user, (social media, snapchat, texting, Spotify, etc.) and this battery lasts me 16 hours. This is the first phone I have ever owned that lasts me the entirety of the day even with how frequently I use it. The screen is beautiful, the display is next-level. I'm extremely impressed and I'm so glad I chose this over the iPhone X. I got this phone after already owning a galaxy, and Best Buy transferred everything from my old phone in 10 minutes. This phone is the best purchase I have made in a long time."
5,"I've been wanting to upgrade my phone but didn't want to pay so much per month. The Black Friday price was half the regular cost. So far, I love this phone."
5,This is a great product from a great store with the best deals available
5,This is a great product from a great store with the best deals available
5,This is a great product from a great store with the best deals available
4,"Works well, great upgrade from S5. I have lots of fun on it."
5,I love the style and color. Also the full screen edge to edge
5,This phone was easy to set up and fun to learn about all the new features.
5,Great phone. Upgrade from the S7 and great battery life.
5,"The best looking phone out there, great battery life, amazing display and performance."
5,"Well, I was on the edge of giving up on Android as a whole. After a horrible experience with the Galaxy S7 Edge, I told myself I was going back to Apple. However, the S8 managed to get my attention and I am glad it did because it is the best phone you can get on Android. It hardly ever slows down, and the hardware like the camera is amazing."
5,Upgraded from s6 to s8 and samsung did not disappoint phone seems slimmer and not sure about the rounded sides yet but g ok ng to give it a try.
4,signed up for verizon and can not activate verrizon needs # and I don't no what it is
5,Great phone all around. Optimal for one hand use. I find it better in every day use than bigger phone like Note 8.
5,Great phone and great in store customer service! A+
5,Product was easy to use right away. Speed is so much faster between apps than my old Turbo 2 Droid.
5,"Overall, e phone was a good upgrade. It is easy to use. The camera works well."
4,I love this new phone. The screen is larger. The camera works really well. What I don't like about is the new USB port. I had to buy a new car charger for my phone.
5,The Samsung S8 is a thing of beauty. Great design and feel in the hand. Screen is awesome and phone is super fast.
5,"I've looked at several devices from Samsung, and this was the one that made me jump being that it was the perfect balance of Screen Size, battery life, internal memory, and performing better than advertised. I would purchase this again, and am quite happy with it."
5,Phone is great and easy to use and load apps. Screen is large enough to see but not too big to put in pocket
5,"I love my new phone, battery life is great, the pictures are awesome. Very easy to use."
5,This mobile phone is the best one on the market with all the latest features before any other brand!! Never had any problems with the battery overheating or dieing to soon plus if it did die you have access to inside your phone to change yourself!
5,"My last Samsung phone had been the Note 2 and I really hated touch wiz and some other annoying features. I have always pushed for better value phones but when this one was cheap enough and I didn't have a better option I reluctantly bight the S8. I have been really happy. TouchWiz is no longer laggy, the phone looks great, takes good pictures, and runs whatever I need it to. I really push the phone and it's battery still lasts.the fingerprint reader is annoyingly placed but I have gotten used to it and it is not an issue. The only concern is the bixbie button (which I can now disable) but the volume keys are now hard to reach. Not worth docking a star though. This really is a great phone."
5,Great phone. I had a S6 and passed buying the S7 and bought this one instead. Glad I waited. Great phone.. clear screen and easy to navigate.
5,My S3 died and I chose to take my wife's S7 and get her the S8 and she likes it better than S7
5,Haven't had any issues with it. Loving my new phone!
5,Camera and video quality is best out there ! Love love my Samsung 8!
5,"This phone has lot of new things on it,that I'm getting use too. I just love this phone"
5,"This phone is reliable, battery almost always has a lot of power, beautiful pics from camera..."
4,"I have not yet been able to figure out how to keep Bixby from turning on randomly. I'm sure it is operator error, but it is annoying!"
5,This is my favorite phone I have ever had. I would recommend this to anyone. Only way I would switch this phone is if samsung comes out with better.
5,Eyelike how fast the camera takes pictures the screen and all of the apps that are added on
5,Upgraded from S5 to S7. Really like the ease of using this new phone.
5,Samsung is simply the best the new Galaxy takes amazing pictures Is very quick and responsive This phone does everything and more. It seems like all other companies are trying to play catch up with Samsung's technology
4,Impressive in many ways. My complaint is that it seems to change settings all on it's own!
5,This phone is great! Fast and user friendly. Good camera.
4,"I really love my Samsung S8, but hate that I got it just a few weeks before the price dropped"
4,Really like this phone. Been a Samsung user before. Prefer over the IPhone. One star short due to some frustration with swiping up the icons on the bottom
5,"Many improvements over the S4, though it does ta me s one time to get used to."
5,I absolutely love this phone. So much better than an IPhone. So happy that Samsung is continuing their excellence.
4,Screen size great for watching video hard to use with one hand. Good photos.
5,Been iPhone user. Changed to the Samsung and so glad i changed!!
5,Samsung is a great phone which is easy to use and the size is perfect and fits comfortably in my purse.
5,We actually agree on our phone upgrades this time as this one fixed all the previous glitches. Love the Samsung !
5,"Great phone. Phone reception,4g and wifi very good. Takes excellent, detailed photos. Very happy with it"
4,"Sometimes it won't recognize my fingerprint. That's a little inconvenient, but otherwise I have been loving it."
4,Battery lasts at least a day with moderate use. Phone is water resistant and works well. Software is easy and intuitive.
3,The Samsung galaxy S8 is a very nice phone. The camera takes great photos and the battery life is very good. Had a Samsung galaxy s6 and am very glad I upgraded.
5,Great phone with a great camera. Screen is awesome. Had to go with liquid screen protector because nothing glass fits curved screen very well. So far so good.
5,"The Samsung Galaxy s8 is a step above any phone. Great camera, great features, and easy to use!"
4,Just switched from an iPhone to a galaxy s8. Not loving Bixby. I liked the price.
4,I just switched from an iPhone to a galaxy. Still getting used to throw differences. Not loving Bixby as much as siri. I liked the price $300 off.
5,"This was the first phone I ever got on launch day. It's beautiful, perfectly sized, great screen, great camera, and very durable. This phone will last me years at the very least."
5,I have had my phone for a few month and love it. Found a lot of good accessories and it syncs perfectly with my Samsung Gear watch.
4,"Had to get a new phone since I was running out of storage on my Galaxy S5. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has 64 MB plus an expansion slot. Easy to use and was able to customize it in a day. Only complaint is the bloatware both Samsung and Verizon shove onto the phone. Can't delete it, just disable it. So it takes up space. Good thing this phone has the expansion slot. I will eventually need it."
5,I have had this phone since June and I'm still loving it. I like the edge feature. It makes quick accesses to the apps I use the most.
5,"No problems so far, I have had great success with this phone."
4,got rid of s6 terrible battery this phone alot the same with many better things battery better but nit great
4,This is the best Samsung phone that I have bought in the last ten years. It is easy to use and the camera takes clear photos.
5,LOVE the Samsung galaxy s8. And the fact that it was 300$ cheaper
5,Very nice! The phone with easy to use functions. :)
5,Very nice phone. Great on screen picture & camera.
4,I love it and it keeps improving and getting better.
5,Great phone. Love the screen size. And never had a problem with android phoness
1,"Back cover cracked for no reason less than 24 hours after I bought it. Didn't even take the plastic covering off it yet! For the short time I had it, I have nothing bad to say."
5,Best phone out there right now. Have compared it with many others and hands down this is the best!!
4,My wife and I recently upgraded our Galaxy S5’s to the S8. The phone is an overall nice improvement. The one gripe so far is both of our S8 phones don’t deal well with glass screen protectors. The screen sensitivity is greatly reduced with a glass type protector. So much so that I ended up removing my glass screen protector. Our S5’s both had glass screen protector without issue. Upon doing some research we are not the only ones with this issue on the S8’s.
5,Upgraded from the s5. Basically the same as the s5. With a few improvements. The camera takes fantastic pictures.
5,This Samsung phone is an excellent phone. It is superior in every way to all of the iPhones I have owned in the past. The photos are of excellent quality and the picture goes all the way to the curved edge of the screen on the phone. The price i paid was also much less than any of the iPhones offered at the time of purchase.
5,Great phone has a nice camera battery life is good was just a little bigger than the 7
5,"I decided to switch from my Apple 6s to the Samsung 8. So glad I did. It has great sound and pictures. It is very easy to use, to customize and has thousands of available apps. Apple has a too dedicated system. It used to be more user friendly but not anymore."
5,Great screen clarity. Camera takes excellent pictures. Ease of using icons. Love it.
5,"All new technology, but still easy to operate. All good."
5,The S8 has everything I could ask for and more. I was impressed by the battery life and the responsiveness of the operating system. The waterproof rating has come in handy as well.
5,Better response and faster charge and better pictures
5,I love my phone. The color is beautiful and the functionality of the phone is great. It has many wonderful features you would expect from a Samsung product.
5,"This phone is the best iteration of the galaxy series - I could take or leave the curved edges, but the speed, performance, and clarity of this phone are spectacular. Add in the water resistance, expandable memory, headphone jack, and ""always-on"" info display, and you have a great phone."
5,Sales rep was great at his job and I love the phone
4,Love everything but the text to talk feature. Not as easy to use
5,This phone has been nothing short of amazing. Would definitely reccommened
4,when I just got the phone it was giving me trouble with keeping connected to my WiFi but I performed an update and it was enough to get it to work just greatly.
5,"Excellent phone, good battery life and never lags."
5,"The screen resolution is awesome and the processor is really fast. 
The camera is a lot faster and sharper that my old Samsung.'"
4,"The phone has a great feel to it. Easy to understand, and the expanded screen is nice. Easy to toggle between screens. However the keypad is a little small. Great camera and has a lot of storage."
5,It's my wife's phone but she loves it. Got it for cheap on a Friday. Great sale!! Easy to activate on our family plan as well!
5,I've been team Samsung since the smart phone came out. I will never leave this brand! The phone is AMAZING!!!! Drop it in a body of water i dare you!!! Best feature of this phone is the underwater capability!
5,I had previously owned the S5 and S6 but went to a V10 on a recommendation. It lasted less than a year before it shut off one day and refused to turn back on. I went back to the S8 and love it! I won't use any other phone.
5,This phone is the perfect size for me. Not to big and not to small. Fit's perfect in my pocket. The camera is awesome. I've had this phone for a few months now and have not had any problems so far.
5,I bought this Samsung S8 phone and I love it very sleek and I love the blue color that is only at best buy and works great
5,"This is the best phone. I absolutely love it. I chose the Samsung Galaxy 8 for my 1st smart phone because it was the latest version, and am obsessed with all its great features."
5,Fairly easy to use. Takes great pictures. Good battery life.
4,Nice quality cameras front n back. Hd video is nice and like how i can swithch from video call to hd voice call.
4,"The phone is very responsive and looks really good, im glad i chose to go with this"
5,live the phone i purchased at the visalia best buy
5,Like other Galaxy series phones this is the FLAGSHIP phone for android - great camera and software and easy to use.
5,"I spent some time reviewing different phones and chose this one because it was easy to use and not too big. It's loaded with excellent state-of-the-art and user-friendly features. Haven't had it very long, but I'm already 'into' it. It's definitely a big improvement over an older smart phone that I've retired. The price was right too."
4,The phone holds a charge well and is very quick to charge
5,"Great battery life, a beautiful screen and fast processing power are the highlights of the S8. Samsung's new personal assistant, Bixby, takes a bit of getting used to but it is incredibly valuable once you complete the learning curve. The screen quality is the most beautiful I have seen on a phone yet. The storage space (64GB) is insane and adding a memory card makes it feel like you can have storage that won't run out. I do miss the physical home button that the Galaxy series has become known for, though. The Best Buy exclusive blue color is a nice, light shade of blue that is understated but still sleek and noticebale."
4,"Its a great phone. High memory, fast internet, easy to use."
5,"I love my new Samsung S8+. I was having a hard time seeing the screen on my old phone, but I love the larger screen on the S8+. It also takes great pictures and is very user friendly. I liked it so much I talked my son into getting the same phone."
5,I like my new phone. It works exactly what I expected!
5,I love this new Samsung Galaxy 8s. Overall great phone. Pictures look great. Easy to use with a very sleek look.
5,The new galaxy s8 is fantastic. I love the new edge to it and the fingerprint login as well.
5,"This was an upgrade from the Galaxy s6. Daughter loves the phone. Great battery life. Sharp, clear screen. An added bonus is that Best Buy gave us a nice-sized gift card for trading in the old phone even though it was on it's last leg."
5,"after about 6 months of use.... still loving this phone... had upgraded from an S4 and man was that night and day diff... this thing actually reacts when you want something, you dont have to wait 10 seconds.. been a fan of samsung phones and will stick with them, but maybe wont wait the 3-4 years to upgrade again."
5,This is the best Samsung Galaxy yet. I love the larger screen. And the battery lasts forever. You will not be sorry if you get this phone!
5,Very dependable good battery life can use portable charger
5,"Phone has great reception, fast speed would definitely recommend to others!"
5,Phone has good reception and fast speed! Would definitely recommend to others!
5,"Very nice phone, got a good deal on it at best buy mobile at the Victorville mall Kudos!! Bought three of them at the same time. Works great, need to relocate the fingerprint scanner, but you know that already."
5,"Very nice phone, got a good deal on it at best buy mobile at the Victorville mall Kudos!! Bought three of them at the same time. Works great, need to relocate the fingerprint scanner, but you know that already."
5,"Very nice phone, got a good deal on it at best buy mobile at the Victorville mall, Kudos!! Bought three of them at the same time. Works great, need to relocate the fingerprint scanner, but you know that already."
4,No troubles with this phone. Loved my s7 and this is similiar. I do have difficulty with the photo gallery but that is probably just me.
5,"So far so good, great features, great size. Still fits in pocket. Awesome battery life."
4,This phone case has good protection but makes touchscreen a little difficult.
5,This is a great phone with lots of upgrades. Very satisfied with it.
5,This is a great phone with lots of upgrades. Very satisfied with it.
5,"Beautiful design, the display is the best ive seen from a smart phone, cant complain."
5,"this is a great phone!. I have the galaxy 7, but bought this for my son and my already jealous. great camera and screen resolution is fantastic"
5,Great phone so far. Long battery life. User friendly.
5,The galaxy S8 is a great phone and I am coming from the LG V10 which quit on me and thank God for the cloud. This phone is amazing and I am sure it has all types of features that I haven't tried yet.
4,This phone has all the features I've wanted. No more upgrading every year.
5,Great! smaller than the 8+ so it is more manageable.
5,"This product is smarter than I am, and it's a good thing because it answers my operational questions. Great camera with post production software!"
5,I went from the s7 to the s8. BB had a great deal. There's not much difference in the 2 phones but the price made in worth it.
5,"This phone has excellent battery life, takes amazing pictures and,the new Bixby digital assistant feature will blow your mind!"
5,"It's a great phone to have. The speed, the clarity of pictures and I love how it adapts the screens lighting."
5,"This phone is the mad note! Stoopid, dope, phat! Nah mean?"
5,I knew the Galaxy S8 was going to be great but I wasn't expecting such an incredible camera!!! Love the pics I take so much more!
5,Needed a new phone for a long time and the Samsung 8 did not disappoint.
5,"Had an S5. Debated on getting the S7 and the S8 is the way to go! Love the camera, screen size and clarity."
4,Ease of use but the battery drains faster compared to Samsung Galaxy S3 that i ised to have.
5,"I have only ever been an iphone user, but 2 months later and i couldn't be happier with making the switch. Great camera and there's so much more you can do with it."
5,I purchased this to replace my Galaxy 4. Nice size and very fast. Some features are slightly different. Overall a great phone.
4,I love the phone itself. The Android version on it is extremely easy to use and very stable. The only complaint I have is that the screen is very easy to crack and the curved edges make it necessary to have a phone case so you are not accidentally pressing things on the side of your screen all the time.
5,Very good phone. Many many features without the iPhone price!
4,Good phone lots of space and great camera. Takes awesome photos.
5,Awesome features easy to operate great size great camera
4,"Great battery life, love the curved screen. Could use better touch sensitivity."
5,Great took time to make sure it was going to wook for me and my business!
5,"Love this phone, great camera, great battery life."
4,"I've always loved the Samsung galaxy phones and wasn't disappointed when I went back to this one. The only thing I don't like is the glass back because I dropped it and it cracked on me. The camera is phenomenal, the vr stuff is really cool, it's super fast, and I love the edge."
4,"Great smart phone .
The only con is the battery doesnt last a day"
4,So far it’s working as promised. Was relatively easy to set up!
5,"In love with this phone. Battery life has improved over the generations of galaxy phone's! Excellent camera, user friendly!"
5,I had a Samsung 3 and went to a Samsung 8. It was like I never had a smart phone before. It's so fast and holds a charge for a long time compared to my Samsung 3. The voice tone on phone calls is so clear. Love everything about it.
4,The best thing about the S8 is the battery power. It lasts all day. Other than that not impressed so much. Had a few issues with it turning off and not wanting to turn back on.It doesn't seem to be sluggish.The screen is bright and vibrant.
5,"Fast, lightweight, fantastic screen picture! The camera is amazing, I could not be happier."
5,I got the new Galaxy S8 after my Galaxy S6 suddenly died on me at my mother-in-law's birthday party. I lost everything on the phone but the new S8 more than made up for it with all its awesome features and Sleek look
5,"It's fast, big and easy to use. It has a great front and back camera."
5,Really happy with this phone. Lots of memory and memory card compatibility. Long battery life and rapid recharge.
5,Will never buy an apple iphone. Samsung phones are so much better. Got the s8 a couple months ago and I have no problems
5,"Bought this phone for my son, he loves the features and enjoys it in general"
4,I'm a Samsung person. This is my 3rd Samsung phone. The 8 is thin and long. I like that but I wish it was wider like my 5. It works great. Fast. And the pictures are amazing quality.
5,Works great no issues and with a case on it I feel more secure about handling it. Camera is great and battery life is great for how much I am on it
5,"I like this phone, it has more memory then my Edge 7"
5,The double edge rocks!. screen resolution is very good and vivid. Camera excellent
5,Smoothest/fastest OS I've felt on a phone. Batter lasts a full day on one charge. Screen is like butter.
5,"The screen is beautiful, the camera is great, build quality is absolutely amazing, battery could be better but overall I'm really happy with this purchase."
5,Very stylish and good quality. It's thin and the design is good.
3,"Always been an Android fan. Had a Nexus 6P and decided to upgrade to the Galaxy S8 but it wasn't an upgrade. I love the phone design, style and features but I just don't think it will be as reliable and bullet proof as the Nexus 6P was. I have only had the Galaxy S8 for 2 months and it seems to be getting worse with issues. The phone freezes randomly during various things. Occasionally it will unfreeze but 9 times out of 10 it requires me to force a soft reset by holding the volume down and power button to FORCE a restart. I have done a full factory reset 2 times. Replaced the external SD card, ran it without the SD card and no change. Ran it factory stock with no apps installed. It may freeze up trying to open Pandora and it may freeze up after a call and stay stuck in the call screen not even allowing you to answer calls back from the person it just dropped the call from. Samsung has a built in app for help but the ""expert"" help suggests all the stuff I have already tried. Next step is to send it back to Samsung for a replacement which would leave me without a phone and that's not a viable solution right now since I run a business. Android Oreo is supposed to be out in the next couple months and I really hope it fixes whatever issue is happening. If not, I have to bite the bullet and send it and and start from scratch again. PS... the Nexus 6P got passed down to my son and he's managed to drop it twice, crack the screen and dump a class of soda on it and it's still running strong and not missing a beat."
5,Love the new security features. The fingerprint login makes it so much to while on the go.
5,I got this phone for my wife and she loves it! Cool!
5,I went through years of buying sub-par phones just for the sake of trying to save money but after my job depended on me to have a much more capable device...I realized that the investment is REALLY worth it.
5,"Perfect size..great color..wish the edges were flat not curved...very good phone.
Easy to navigate. Good battery life"
4,I have had this phone for 3 months and I love the Android operating system mixed with Samasung technology. The only complaint I have is how fragile the screen is. Cracked mine within a few weeks and used the insurance to get a new one.
5,Took me awhile to finally decide on what phone to upgrade to but I am very pleased with my choice. This phone is awesome. It does everything and had some pleasant surprises. Like wireless charging and Bixby. The headphones that came with it are awesome too.
2,Have owed the galaxy family of phones over the years and this is by far the worst design. Only positive in extra memory
5,When I saw the s8 in blue I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately there was a manufacturer Issue with it and I had to bring it back to the store. They were able to get me the exact same one within minutes and the staff was friendly and very helpful
5,I have used this phone for a while and I am 100 percent in love with the ease of use of this phone. I have bought several of the phones becasue I an in love with it.
5,Great phone wish I would of gotten the 8+ Went from a note 5 to just the s8
5,Great phone that is easy to use. Holds charge very well. Camera is outstanding.
4,"I upgraded from the S7 to the S8 due to my monthly cost becoming lower. There are so many AMAZING new features on the phone. Yes, there was a small learning curve. I used a manual and a cheap book that I bought. I really like Bixby and it does things that even Alexa couldn't do. The battery lasts much longer. The positives go on. The only current negatives which is big is that my phone completely froze 2x's in the past week."
5,I prefer samsung over apple because of the tons customization options.
5,"Great product, just doing this to recieve bonus points"
5,A nice upgrade from my GS6. Easy to use. Great pics. Nice shortcuts. Slim sleek phone.
5,I love my new phone. I had an older Galaxy and upgraded. I don't think I would ever use another brand.
4,Great phone great deal. Battery life needs improving.
3,"Best phone I have ever had. Dropped twice, with case, cracked screen both times???
Samsung is fixing ( over $200). Local quotes to fix, over $340."
5,"The camera... high quality and lots of features. Sound quality... excellent. Samsung apps... many useful apps, a few not so much. Battery life... pretty good but not as good as expected although I do use it heavily, mostly for pictures and marine nav/chart apps. Bixby... HATE it and can't uninstall or disable the button which I hit constantly by mistake. Color... can't see it under my case, but still think it's lovely. Overall, love the phone and quite happy with it when Bixby doesn't make me mad."
5,"The phone is clear, crisp, easy to use. Love the finger print reader. Only disappointment: When using the 'telephoto' lens feature with the camera, the photos are extremely pixelated at max zoom. This of course is an issue caused by current day cell phone camera technology in general, not only with this phone"
2,Had 7 edge prior to this device loved it never had issue with reception. I have had horrible reception issues at my home office and my office (about 10 miles away) I had device replaced once and we did all the voo doo that Verizon could think of except do what I wanted and replace with a 7. So anyway canceled service and have like new Galaxy 8 for sale
4,"I tried switching from an Iphone to the Samsung. After havng it for several weeks (to give it a fair chance), I am disappointed. I will switch back to the iPhone."
5,Samsung does it again with another amazing phone!!
5,Best phone on the market. Pick up to see for yourself.
5,"Upgraded from the S7 while they had a great deal going on, love the new phone."
5,Love the Galaxy series. Not much different than my S7 except for a couple options. Liking those though.
5,"The S8 is my first android phone. I have been an iPhone user for the past 7 years. I was getting sick of Apple way of ""being the best"" (but not really). I wanted something new and a change of pace. The S8 was the phone I was looking for. The display is stunning, and the phone has a multitude of capabilities. However, there are a few shortfalls to the phone. The first is that android technology does not incorporate a percentage indicator for Bluetooth devices. While this may seem picky, one does not like their headphones dieing on them in the middle of a great workout. Secondly the Bluetooth is not what it's cracked up to be. My iPhone 6 had a much longer range for its Bluetooth. I could play my wireless speaker in the basement while standing on my first floor and it would be clear. The S8 breaks up as soon as I go to the second floor. Overall, great phone but needs some improvement."
4,The cellphone itself is very impressive by its look and it's screen
5,"Reviews claiming this is the best phone available are probably true...phone is more advanced than this user! The only irritant is the screen often covers the ""back"" arrow at the bottom, so you always have to move the screen edge up to show the arrow...fairly irritating..."
4,"Went from an iPhone to the Galaxy S8 a few months ago. At first I was quite skeptical, but it has turned out to be a pretty awesome swap. The battery lasts way longer, and I have had less problems while traveling."
5,I love this phone. So easy to use and the camera is great
5,I love the camera on this phone! I can't say enough about it. Fantastic
5,Good camera an good colors. Lots of room for downloads
4,"With Best Buy's deals, got this phone for HALF the price other places were selling it for. The phone is pretty good, though I miss the camera I had with the Pixel. The screen is gorgeous, and usability is good. I don't, however, like the Bixby button and some of samsung's apps."
5,"The look of the screen is awesome! I love the slight curve on the edges, and the feel of it in the hand. Battery is not too bad, and usually can make it through a full day without having to charge. If you do have to charge though, the quick charging is very fast! Love this phone!"
5,"I have always had Galaxy's and this one does not disappoint. Sleek design, brilliant features."
5,"The phone is excellent in almost every way. The fingerprint scanner on the back isn't a big deal for me, and I do use it all the time."
5,"My Samsung S8 is the best phone yet. Not to big or small, great features, increased speed."
4,"I really like this phone. The ""edge"" screen is very cool. The speaker is on the bottom of the phone not the back. So you don't have to turn it over. My only complaint is the location of the Bixby button. My thumb always ends up pushing it when putting the phone into sleep mode. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars."
4,I love the way the screen wraps around the edge of phone!! Another great feature is being able to hide the navigation bar when you want and if not you can lock it to stay on bottom of screen!!
5,Love it so far had an s6 and loved it also. Great camera
5,The phone is fast and runs much better than my last phone. I haven't had any trouble with it yet.
5,I am a iPhone person and recently moved to the Samsung which has great features
4,"I had been waiting for the Note 8 to come out and when it finally did... it was not worth the cost difference from the S8 or S8 plus. The S8 fits better in my hand and easier to use that the S8 plus. 

The camera is good but not as easy to quickly launch as the old Note 7. Low light and motion is not as good as I hoped for. Takes great pictures just not magic. 

I use my phone all day long and the battery hold up well!"
2,Screen prone to cracking with minor contact. Best Buy did not stand behind the product but simply referred to carrier.
4,Phone is awesome but the screen scratches way to easy.
4,Upgraded to Samsung S8 from note 3. Easy to use great pictures.
5,This phone has quick connections performances and doesn't overheat.
4,"Easy to use. Light weight and fits in one hand. Camera is excellent taking ultra clear pics with amazing color quality. Only negative, I've had to restart the phone after freezing."
4,I bought this phone to replace my iPhone 4 and just love it so many cool thing in this phone
5,Replaced my S5 with the S8 and what a difference it makes!
5,I have been holding out on upgrading my Samsung Galaxy S4 for many years. Very glad I finally did!
5,The Samsung galaxy S8 battery last longer than the S7.
5,"Great Phone so far. Bought it for my father which is his first smart phone. He loves the features, screen and finger print scanner. States the phone feels just right in his hand and easy to manuvear with the other hand. No issues so far."
4,This is a great phone. Awesome picture quality when viewing videos.
5,"The best phone I've ever had. Samsung does it again. The screen looks amazing. I love the new home button, even though it's digital now it still works just like the physical one. Beautiful, fast phone with great cameras and all the features you expect from a Galaxy."
5,This phone was for my husband. He had a S7 and was half way through paying it off. He loved that phone. I talked him into letting me upgrade him with some teeth pulling. My main reason was because upgrading would save us $10 a month. Why wouldn't you do that and get a better phone. He loves it. It is fast and crisp and sharp. The upgraded storage is a plus. He won't admit it but he loves it. Best Buy has the best prices if you are willing to hold off a month or 2 after it is released. If you were debating on whether or not to get it then I hope you take my advise and just pull the trigger.
5,Much easier to purchase cell phone from best buy than Verizon. Faster and cheaper
5,"This phone is everything I have grown to expect from Samsung. Fast, sleek, and powerful. Awesome battery life."
4,Love the bigger screen & increased storage capacity.
5,This phone does more than I can ever imagine I'm still learning but I like it and what I can do with it is awesome
5,Got this phone for my wife who loves it! Big enough screen and finally a phone that she has not had issues with!
5,"Powerful phone with nice, clear screen. Very fast with a lot of memory."
4,"I went from a Samsung S4 to the S8. Its a really nice phone, great camera but I wish it didn't have the curved screen."
5,The s8 is great. Great camera and size. A lot more storage space i believe.
4,"a big improvement over the S7. I wish it had a removable battery, but other than that I am happy"
5,"Great phone, great battery life, great screen, I love and highly recommend it."
4,I went from a Samsung 3 to a Samsung 8. Oh my what a difference. I am still learning the basics.
5,This is an awesome phone! I love it! The salesperson in mobile Alexis was a great help through the whole transaction.
5,"This phone has great features, and performance, has good battery life, excellent picture and audio."
4,"This smartphone does so many things, it is amazing. I,ve had good luck on transmit/receive in a mountainous area where there IS a difference in performance. But I get tired of so many ads for stuff I'm not interested in, programs I don't want, and ""good features"" I don't want (Full screen taking away the back up and home screen buttons when I want to keep them on,) (Or not enough info to get it back.)"
4,Very knowlegable and helping staff.Waiting time is really short as enough staff is there to take care.They helped me to choose a nice phone with some currently going on offer
5,The samsung phone is what i expected. I would recommend to friends.
5,This phone has been great. It was about $400 cheaper than a comparable iPhone. It has all the features plus it is water prrof and the battery is a big step up from older models.
5,The Samsung galaxy S8 is a great phone and it's easy to use.
5,I love this phone. My only complaint is the home screen button seems to have disappeared after a recent update on certain apps
5,My husband loves this phone. His last phone was an IPhone. He likes this one so much better!
5,First phone for my grandson. Many good features and he loves it.
5,"Great screen, large enough to see pics but small enough for short fingers :-) Processing time is excellent, lots of internal storage, sound and call quality is great! No complaints!"
5,This phone is the best from Samsung. it has features that bring the technology to life.
5,I'm glad to come back to Samsung. The S8 has a great camera and many features to make it easy to use.
5,The samsung galaxy 8 is a good phone. It's much more advanced than my previous phone. I didn't receive an owner's manual.
5,Awesome screen and great camera Perfect size for One handed use
5,Love the phone got it at a great price works great would buy again
4,"i really like it. I'm not to sure if the edge is good or bad, but good so far."
5,Battery life is great. I usually only have to charge once a day. Camera takes great pictures! Video looks fantastic on this screen!
5,"This is a great phone, super powerful, great screen, best cell phone camera Ive used."
5,"I switched from iPhone to galaxy and I love it 
!"
5,The S8 is the best Galaxy yet. Love the camera. The pictures are beautiful and clear. The only problem I've noticed is the curved edge makes it hard to hit the keys on the outside edge of the screen. It takes a little getting used to at first.
5,"This phone was on sale at a great price and couldn't pass it up. So glad I didn't. This is a great phone. Samsung needs to work out a fee bugs, but I really do like this phone."
5,Made her feel comfortable. 1st smart phone. Fun experience.
4,"I like the phone a lot. SUPER FAST. I like no home button screen. 
Camera is amazing too"
5,Love my Samsung. Very user friendly! So happy that I switched from my iphone.
5,Awesome phone w really sweet new add-ons. Love it.
4,Definitely an upgrade from my s5. Love the sleek design.
5,Great phone and features. Battery charge time is great as well as the amount of usage between charges
5,Works well and has all the bells and whistles. Cheaper than the iphone x.
5,"Had the 6 Edge and made the jump to the 8 as my older phone was having pretty bad battery life. This phone is so sleek and nice, and aside from aesthetics the specs are pretty awesome too. Generally use for photos, texting, calls, web browsing and light ""gaming"". Does well for all I need, battery is great. Can extend memory with the SD card and Bluetooth 5.0 is a plus. One and only gripe is that Samsung removed the IR Blaster so I can no longer use my phone as a remote for my non-smart TV. Not that bad in the grand scheme of things."
5,"I was nervous about upgrading to this phone with the negative reviews online about the screen and back easily cracking with a short drop or sitting on it. I'm very rough on my phones and tend to drop it at least once a day. I put a Tech 21 case on it and over a month later it still looks brand new. The screen width and picture is amazing. It seems clearer than the S7. While I tried Bixby, but ran into too many snags having to program shortcuts and yelling at it and nothing, by then it going off when we are having a conversation in the car. Google does everything I want and the voice response is almost perfect. Google works better on this phone than the S7, too. I also love the edge menu option and use it all the time for my most used apps. I'll never go to an iPhone with the ability to customize this phone and also take pics with my voice."
5,Runs very smooth and easy to use. Maybe a bit too many extras that don't work as well as they should (Bixby).
5,"This is the best phone I've ever owned. Good sound clarity, great screen, and good connectivity. Really couldn't be happier."
5,"Falling in love with this phone. the Cobalt Blue is so pretty. This is my first android phone, there is so much you can do."
5,This is my second smart phone and by far the best. The help I received from the staff was excellent. They answered all my questions and I had a few since at my age (69) technology sometimes over whelms me.
5,"I love this phone. I had the galaxy 7, never liked that one, this 8 has great features that you can use every day. I like the finger print in the back and the picture feature where you just say smile and it snaps the shot. Great"
5,Great cell phone! I love the Galaxy cell phones. Better than iphones!
5,Great cell phone! I love the Galaxy cell phones. Better than iphones!
4,Nice phone but having a hard time getting used to coming from an apple
4,Best buy employees are very nice. They took the time to answer all my questions
5,This is a great phone. The only thing I can think of is that the screen is weak. I dropped mine in a parking lot and the screen shattered.
5,Good phone for an upgrade. Would recommend it to a anyone
4,"The phone has been very good, but I still struggle at times with the new finger print sensor... I also wish the back buttons would stay on screen full time , unless I turn option off. Love camera and speed of phone."
5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said, Samsung phones are the best."
5,"I love the infinity screen on the S8! This phone is fast, and the graphics are amazing when taking photos!! Great battery life!"
5,This phone is not only jammed with bells and whistles (many of which I will never use) but the basic features are the best ever. I can't seem to get the battery below 80% when I use the phone for a full day. The volume of my calls and alerts are loud enough that I can hear them and conversation both on and off Speaker Phone is totally understandable on both ends!
5,Got an awesome deal from Best Buy! Love the easy transition from my old phone to the Samsung Galaxy 8 and also love the amount of charge the phone holds vs. my old phone.
5,I love the phone only bad thing i can say is the curved screen can be annoying at times
5,Very powerful and sleek phone with a great camera. Bixby is one of my favorite features as I can train him/her (you can change the voice in settings) to do almost anything which creates an almost perfect hands-free experience.
5,"Bought this for my Dad, who was coming from the S5. He's not a heavy user of the phone, but he loves it so far. No complaints."
5,I replaced my iPhone 7 with the Galaxy S8 and it was the best decision. It blows iPhone out of the water!
5,I love this phone. The features are amazing. Everyone keeps talking about how Apple is better but Samsung really stepped it its game with this one. Now Apple is trying to be like Samsung w/ all the new feature. I love my Samsung Galaxy S8
5,"Light weight, thin, easy to use, easy to carry, handles being in water, hardy screen. Very versatile phone, great camera - takes extraordinary pictures. Case comes in nice choice of colors. Keep up the great work Samsung!! Totally worth the price!"
3,"Got the phone about 3 months ago, and it worked fine when purchased, and now when leaving the phone aside during the night, the charge goes down to 65% from 100% and I made sure that no apps were running in background. not sure whats wrong but I am having second thoughts of this phone."
4,"My Samsung Galaxy S5 was fully submerged in saltwater and died. The new device is very nice - I was afraid of being forced into the ""edge"" only availability, but at least for now the case seems to provide enough protection."
4,I have loved Samsung phones for a while now and this one is no different. The only thing I miss (I had the Note5 before) is the pen but the water resistant is very nice!
5,The battery life is much better than my previous galaxy. My only complaint is that since it is an edge phone you need to buy a separate glass protection film. And most don't fit correctly. But overall happy with my phone!
4,Fairly easy learning curve. Does more than I will ever need. So far not a fan of the infinity screen.
5,My son & daughter both got S8 phones for $420 & each one came with a samsung gear watch which they both LOVE! Best buy had excellent customer service & overall it was a fantastic experience!
5,"She went from an s6 to the s8 & loves it. It's slim but sturdy, you must have a car on it because it's very slippery."
4,"Phone does everything, is fast, responsive, excellent camera but I don't like the edges, hard to put a screen saver on."
5,Exceptional phone with amazing features. S8 ftw!!!
5,"Really happy with the phone, the screen is beautiful (make sure you get a case) battery life is good as well, overall great phone"
4,It's okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This phone is wonderful. Very responsive and easy to use.
5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said. I echo all the positives with this phone. Battery life is a big improvement over my previous s4. Stepping up the onboard storage to 64gb is a welcome relief. 16gb is not enough today's app sizes. Curved screen looks cool, is surprisingly less annoying than I was expecting it to be, but still can be difficult to navigate when swiping from the edge of the screen from time to time (e.g. dragging to pull up full screen notifications).

My biggest complaint is the non-standard, non-16:9 aspect ratio for the phone. Nice for reading articles, pain for watching video or casting your screen to a monitor or car stereo. Wish they would include the option to cast to a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio."
4,The phone is fast as expected but the screen is not up to par. I bought a bi-fold type phone/screen protector. The phone is 2 weeks old and the credit card in the bi-fold slot has scratched the phone screen. Screens are not impressive and will scratch easily. You better get a screen protector or you will be sorry.
5,Versatile. nice size. excellent qaulity. good color screen. camera is great
4,Upgraded from s5. I loved that thing. Sad no built In IR to use for tv remote and can't use 3rd party mobile hotspots with android 7.0 or later now? I thought the battery life would have been slightly better.
5,Great phone overall! It still feels like a Samsung Galaxy yet it gives you a new phone feel!
4,MY wife really likes her new phone its a lot better than last model
4,I really like my new phone its a lot better than last model
5,"I bought this because I like to listen to music while my phone is charging and I refused to pay for the iPhone's new wireless ear buds. I love the curved screen, and the way the glass goes all the way to the edge. Plus, it is the perfect size--it maximizes screen size, but is still easy to use with one hand reaching from corner to corner."
5,Using Android phone for the first time. I was an Apple loyalist but so far loving S*
5,Su.sung never disappoints. I love all the great additions to the new Samsung s8+
5,"Great feel in the hands, easy transition from previous models, compact design yet full of features! Love the masks on the camera!"
5,"Got my wife one also! This a great phone! We love the quality of the video and the infinity screen gives you so much more picture. Bixby is nice feature, not sure it needed a dedicated button. The biometrics are just ok, sometimes they work other times takes a while to get working (especially facial recognition), kind of defeats the purpose if I have to enter a code."

4,"I had the Note 5, I liked the Note better. The S8 was smooth, it takes a little while to get use to not having the home key in the front, but it's a great product."
5,Samsung has outdone themselves!! Easy to use awesome pics!
4,"This works out for me and my family, and the battery life is fantastic."
5,"Upgrading from an S5, I was torn between the S8 and the S8+. I couldn't justify the extra cost for .4"" with every other spec the same. Very happy with the purchase."
5,Get Lifeproof case. Glass screen protectors are terrible due to the curved screen.
4,"This phone looks great and is easy to use. Camera takes great pictures, screen is vibrant, and the charge lasts all day. The only problem I had is the UBS Type C connector did not fit. The salesman said it was a manufacturing defect. I bought a new charging cord and everything is fine (that was a lot better than screwing around sending the cord back to Samsung).

The Best Buy deal on this phone makes it a no brainier. Thanks Best Buy!!"
5,Like the slim look on phone and edge most recent app. feature.
4,I like Samsung s8 phone. Great phone. It can take awesome pics
5,I love this phone ! easy to use pictures are amazing. you will have to download some picture apps from Samsung to get the best pictures but they are all free.
4,"This is a great versatile phone. Android offers so many automated features to run your work area and home. This phone is fast, bright, and the design is great except for the glass. I don't believe it to be gorilla glass grade. Mine cracked so easily. Replacement is $300+"
4,My Aunt lives in a remote area of AK. She had an iPhone that did not get very good reception. This phone is much better for her needs.
4,"This is a great phone. I could do without the curved edges, but overall it is a great phone."
5,"Great phone, I hated past galaxy's I really took a risk of hating this phone. I love it charges fast. Quick response and was a great deal thanks to Best Buy"
5,Absolutely love the new S8 and the Best Buy gift card that came with it!
2,"In the two weeks I had this phone it became apparent that there are many technical issues with this phone. Sure it's pretty and has amazing picture but it constantly freezes, requiring a soft restart. It get hot, surprise surprise, and has touchscreen issues. It also seemed slower than my previous phones, not quick response. I returned it and just kept using my old phone."
4,"I really like the phone, but the conversion tool does not work well. Still cannot get Outlook to transfer or even install. Many other apps did not transfer but did manually install. Love the phone otherwise."
4,"(+) A beautiful phone all around.

(-) A slippery phone that needs a tough case AND an invisishield-type screen protector. A cracked screen will cost you $300-400+ to repair, if you get the insurance you pay a $250 deductible."
5,Went back to Samsung after trying an iPhone. I missed this phone!
5,"Love, love this phone. So many fabulous features like Bixby. Long battery life, finally I can go all day without worrying I need to be near a charger. Screen and camera are amazing, takes awesome pictures. I haven't tested the water resistance feature but I'm sure I will one day. 
Get this phone!!!"
5,I could update with grate deal and camera is amazing.
5,This phone really has all the features I want. Love it.
4,I have had this phone a month and it is great. It is very easy to navigate and it far outshines my last phone.
5,"My wife and I were both in need of a phone upgrade and we JUMPED when we saw Best Buy was offering $300 back on the new Samsung S8. Having researched the phone thoroughly and found that almost everyone was pleased with the new phone, we didn't even hesitate to go for it. I'm pleased to say that within the first month, the phone has not disappointed. Fast, efficient, great camera, quick response, larger screen. I'm in love with this phone. Thanks, Best Buy! And thanks, Samsung!"
4,"I just upgraded from the galaxy s5 so this is quite the improvement. This phone works great and is fast. I love the amount of memory plus the expandable option. There are only two things I've come across that I don't like. I don't like the placement of the Bixby button and headphone jack. They are in the way often. The other thing is that I cannot get a tempered glass protector due to the edges which don't really need coverage on the little side sliver. It just needs to cover the whole front. Other than that, I've had it a month and a half and love it."
5,"Great phone, even better the camera!!! I should have gotten it sooner!!"
5,"I've had the Galaxy S8 for a few weeks now and really like it. It's easy to use, very slim and lightweight."
5,"Great phone, easy to navigate. Like the sharpness of screen"
5,"My wife and I each bought the S8, and the learning curve from my S5 was frustrating for a couple days. My wife who is less tech-savvy, and was upgrading from a S4, had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the changes. She is happy with it now."
5,"A bit of a learning curve to master the changes from the S5, but once I got it, a great upgrade. Love the camera, and the sound for vids and music is also quite good."
5,"The S8 is incredibly fast, with a great slim design. I've owned several Galaxy phones and this is the clear front runner. The back is a smudge magnet tho, and with the curved edges it's hard not to have a case on it"
5,Was nervous switching from an iPhone to this but cannot beat the deal I got not to mention the transition has been easy and the picture quality is so much better.
5,"Omg Bixby you suck. Go to app store purchase Samsung app disabler and turn all Bixby features off. Trust me. In fact turn off all bloat ware that this phone is jammed packed with. You can get a full list of apps safe to disable if you google it. The button is in a location where no matter what you will push button and open app. Other than that the phone is great. Fast, and crisp. HD movies, games, and everything in between can't slow down this phone. Very responsive and battery life is way better than expected. Wireless charging is another great feature. My dock is on my nightstand so I don't have to fidget with plugging it in if I need to answer or use it. If the they placed the Bixby button on top of the phones edge I would give it 5 stars but since I now have a useless button on my phone I give it 4 stars. I will try and figure ok it if I can make the button do another function later. Awesome phone."
5,Camera works much better than former models. Nice phone!
5,The new phone is awesome!! Can't say enough about the battery life!
5,Works verily easily. Great display. Runs quickly. Sound is great.
5,"Not only is this phone amazing with camera quality and durability, I saved $300 going through Best Buy instead of Verizon direct. What's not to love?"
5,"Had great service, tech was wonderful, Checkout fast"
5,"Best phone I've ever had, by far! Battery life is outstanding. Camera has so many great features and is as good as advertised. I still don't really get the draw to the infinity screen though.."
5,"The Samsung S8 is amazing . I upgraded from an S5,what a difference. If you buy one make sure you get a case friendly screen protector. If the screen protector goes too far over the edge the case wants to push the screen protector off."
5,Replaced my Samsung 5 with the new Samsung Galaxy 8 and I am very pleased with all the upgrades. It has a full screen and camera takes beautiful pictures and Bixby is a great new feature.
5,The speed of the cpu and the camera focus is fantastic.
5,This phone is easy to use...some upgrades take a lot of time to learn..not this one..love it!
5,"Love the camera on this phone, it takes amazing pictures. Great phone, I like the size, the weight, the speed. It was a little slippery until I got a decent case for it. Overall - love it."
5,Love it! It was purchased for my boy and he loves it
5,I upgraded from the Samsung 6. The Samsung 8 is faster brighter and sharper. I am very happy with the phone.
5,"I have always had Samsung phones, but recently considered making the popular switch to an iPhone...after much deliberation, I decided to go with the S8. I'm so happy I did. Recently my work gave everyone iPhones and I still prefer my S8. I find the S8 to be very user friendly and most importantly to me, sturdy. I have dropped it a few times but so far so good...I recommend getting the Geek Squad protection and an Otterbox case."
5,"Got this for my son as a birthday gift upgrade from his S5. Feels high quality, love the screen size. Best buy had the best deal going. Look out Apple, I may switch to Samsung."
5,I researched this phone and its counterpart the Samsung S8 Plus. The features are similar so I decided to go with this one based on the slightly lower price. This phone is sleek and easy to use once you get to know the apps. This is my first Samsung phone and so far it has been a good purchase.
5,Just went to a smart phone. Not to bad to learn and great after you get the hang of it.
5,Great phone with lots of memory. Haven't figured out Bixby yet but hopefully it will be helpful.
5,Nice phone with long lasting battery. Screen resolution is great & phone takes awesome photos.
5,Used the new phone for taking pictures while on vacation; the pictures are crisp and clear.
5,"Quick, responsive, intuitive. Love this phone! I hadn't had a new phone in over three years, and this is leaps and bounds above my old phone."
5,Best cellphone ever!!! I am so happy with this cellphone.
5,"I was apprehensive about switching back to Android from an iPhone, but I am SOOOOO glad I did! I absolutely LOVE this phone; it's fast, the camera is amazing and the edge is so helpful! The clarity and color on this phone exceeds all expectations!"
5,"Best phone on the market! Great camera, Great design and runs smooth and fast!"
5,This is a great phone in every aspect. No features lacking and beautiful design! GREAT CAMERA!
5,I love the finger print unlock... I just place my finger on the sensor and it opens up.
5,This was an upgrade for my GS6 Edge. So far it's does everything my old phone did but better. Battery life is much better.
5,I would recommend this phone. It has a great camera and apps
4,Overall it is a fast phone with lots of options. Great price with $300 off. Curved screen at the edges makes it tough to use some websites. Battery could be bigger. Last complaint.... I fat finger the keyboard on this phone more than any phone I have ever owned. I corrected 5 words in this post.
5,"This Samsung 8 is a great, easy to use phone. The size is perfect and I really like the edges! I highly recommend this phone!"
5,Converted from iPhone to the galaxy finally. And this phone this awesome and the staff at Beat Buy were very helpful in my purchase.
4,top notch screen with beautiful color apps look great super fast
5,I switched from an iPhone to the Galaxy S 8. It was like going from a fiat to a Lexus... love my new S8.. Thank you Best Buy.
5,I love the phone . . . so many features. I haven't even gotten to most of them yet.
5,I am a fan so far. Looks cool and functions easily. Great camera and Bixby works very well. Longevity of the phone is yet to be determined but battery life is decent now and it has plenty of built in memory for most @64gb.
5,This is a good phone for daily use. Lots of memory space. Camera is great.
4,"Samsung galaxy 8 has all you need for taking pictures, watching videos and day to day phone activities."
5,The samsung s8 is an excellent phone. Like the edge to edge coverage. But could be fragile.
5,"Loving this phone. It's slimmed down from the s7 edge, battery life is great. Glad I upgraded!"
5,Can't ask for a better phone. I love it. It just gets better. Samsung makes great phones.
4,"I like the size, camera and clarity. What I don't like is the Bixby vision comes on with every picture..truth I have not had time to mess with it to try and turn it off."
5,The battery life on this phone is fantastic. I can go two full days with regular use before I need to charge it.
5,I got the S8 because my S6 was aging. I'm happy with S8. Nice weight and feel.
4,"Great purchase, worth the wait, I'm still learning all the awesome features that make using this phone so easy"
5,I love this phone! So easy to use and has tons of storage! Battery life is great too.
5,"Great phone, everything works as well as it should. Only thing I don't like is that the screen protector doesn't work with this phone as it makes areas of the phone unresponsive to my normal touch"
5,The s8 is a great phone and has advance quality features.
5,This is everything and more. The phone does everything I need and is fast to keep up with my lifestyle.
4,Great camera and great phone overall. I work in an office that has poor cell coverage and the S8 is much better than my previous phone. It could have better battery life though.
3,Not sure yet. Not real happy with the functionality of it. Don't like VM. Don't like gallery. Phone did not come pre loaded to block pornographic material on the web. Got bombard with pop ups. Had to research how to block it and change settings. Liked my 7 better.
5,I've had the phone for about a month and I love it. it's got great battery life (especially given the built in power-saving modes); an excellent camera and all of my favorite applications run like lightning.
5,Shopped around and came up with a great deal on the new Samsung product.
4,Really enjoy my new Samsung S8. Screen/ picture is so amazing. Great new features.
4,Upgrade from s6 for my wife. Great features & value
5,Love the S8. Has a lot if great new features. Love the edge to edge screen! It's not as wide as my old S5 which is great for someone with small hands.
5,"The colors on the screen are vivid and bright. Easy to see and the night setting that dims the screen as darkness falls. It makes viewing in dark much easier on eyes and ""hides"" the blue light that is apparently not good if you want to sleep at night."
4,We upgraded from an S4. No comparison. Better and increased battery life. Love the edge screen capabilities. Great for watching videos.
5,Unreal speed! Blue coral is a great color on this phone! Awesome!!!!
5,"I have had this phone since its release day and I love it. This phone is easy to use, has a great camera and a super sleek pretty design. The screen size and display are amazing. I don't have any complaints. Love it!"
5,I am trying to get used to my new phone. Something are much different from the Samsung 4.
4,"Faster, cleaner access and better battery life. The wider screen to edge makes for a better reading of email experience."
4,Nice phone and worth the money. Camera works great.
5,Bought this and couldn't be happier! The battery lifeis amazing
4,Nice phone but going from an iPhone it's a bit of a learning curve.
5,"So, I waited forever to upgrade my phone (from an S5). That phone ended up being so glitchy...(my second one) I couldn't stand it any longer. This phone is much more advanced than the S5, it'll probably take me a while to figure out it's full potential. Also, I was very used to width of the S5. The S8 is considerably slimmer. I just have to let you know, get a protective case. Even if you donr like or prefer having a phone case, get one.Even the back of this phone is made of glass (not gorilla glass). I was sad to have dropped it not even a week of getting the phone. I cracked the back a little bit. I have it in a case now, so you can't see it. Aside from that, its a beautiful phone, light, sleek and dare I say sexy."
5,"$300 off for an s8?! talk about a no brainer. Here i am with 2 s7 edges, payhin $33 a piece. Now i only pay $35 for 2 s8's! super happy with my upgrade and Daniel, the guy who helped ne was super awesome and efficient. Thanks BB!!!"
5,much nicer than my galaxy 5. Lots of great features.
5,Everything has been great. Love my phone and the service we got at the store.
5,"Works well, no complaints. The camera is great! My only complaint is no screen protectors available that stay on the edge well."
5,"Great phone, very sleek, works well. I love the purple color. The headphones are awesome too."
5,The Samsung Galaxy 8 is proving to be an awesome phone. Simple to use and fast.
5,The screen is so clear and bigger then my old phone. I love the detail in it.
5,"My new Samsung Galaxy 8 is awesome and I love it. It is taking a while to get use to the new up and down to find everything, but it is well
worth it."
5,"Ive had the phone for about 2 momths now with absolutely no problems, i love it!"
4,I love my phone but wish it was a little bit smaller.
5,"I bought t he Samsung 8 specifically for it's photo abilities. And it hasn't let me down. It has a lot of features which I haven't even began to explore, but my favorite feature is the camera. It also let's you shoot in RAW. I was really surprised to get such greay fireworks photos grom hNd holding this camera. Just set it on auto & it does the rest. You can even review the camera settings after you take a pic."
5,"I'm not one to purchase the latest tech, but rather the older versions. However, I received a no-brainer deal from Best Buy to get this phone with a Verizon Plan.

This phone does everything as expected, and performs well (fast processing, great visuals). I also enjoy the storage space because I listen to a lot of music, podcasts and maintain many files.

My only negatives are as follows: very slippery; screen fades out to sides and sometimes cuts images/buttons off a bit; headjack is on bottom, which tends to get in my way in exercising and holding too often; little things like the screen not transitioning when turned upside down that may be in settings that I haven't found yet."
5,"After being frustrated with the note 7, but a fan of Samsung...decided couldn't pass up the deal on the S8...awesome phone, style, look, function!"
5,Changed from iPhone to this and don't regret it at all
5,Love the camera and size of the phone...if you are not a fan of Apple and you're looking for quality...this is it
4,"The Samsung 8 is a nice phone, not too bulky and easy to use."
4,"It seems to do everything that I expect it to do, I enjoy learning all the new things it does. Really like the camera has great pictures"
5,"I like the phone a lot, very good screen and camera quality"
5,I had an S7 Edge Previously. The S8 has some great additions!
5,Bought a new phone for my wife and she loves the speed of the phone and the long battery life.
5,I love this phone great item great price easy set up
4,Found it easy to use after having the previous phone for so long.
5,This cellular phone came highly recommended by a family member. It would be easer for me been it is large than my current phone.
5,Love the speed and ease of use. Finally upgraded from Galaxy s4.
5,"The best phone I have ever had, tons of features and very easy to deal with"
5,"The best phone I ever hold so far, loaded with features and the camera and speaker are amazing"
5,I had been wanting to upgrade for sometime. This one was worth the wait. Great phone!
5,"The S8 is much faster, has a better camera, and allows use of an SD card which the S6 lacked"
5,"This phone was released at launch from Best Buy, with an incentive...a free Virtual reality headset. As months have passed, they've continued offers to purchase the phone at a discount or with bundle packs. This was a great reason to buy from BB. The phone was available exactly when specified, when preordered, and the pick up procedure as well as coordination to receive the headset, were seamless. highly recommended. the best phone i've ever had!"
4,"love the phone, just amazing. I would recommend to my friends and family"
4,I've had the S8 for about a month and it has many improved features. I am disappointed in the more complicated method for screen mirroring.
5,This phone is awesome. The camera takes great pictures.
5,"I love Samsung for its Galaxy series and this is no exception. Love the display, camera quality and performance. Can't wait for the next in line. :)"
5,Phone is amazing! Love the features and the style. Overall great phone would definitely recommend.
5,nice sleek easy to use just not crazy about the screen and curved corners
5,"Upgraded from a Galaxy GS4 to the GS8 mainly because of memory limitations of the GS4. This phone is way more versatile that the GS4. It can handle more that one email account under the same email button and they are super easy to switch between. Syncs better with my Moto 360 Gen 2 smart watch than the GS4 did and has access to better apps, that automatically appear on the watch once they are installed on the phone. Have not used the camera much yet, but am looking forward to that as well as the camera on the GS4 was lacking."
5,i love this phone. its fast. camera is fantastic. battery live is just fine. solid package
5,"It's awesome. Super fast and the battery life is amazing.
I don't like Bixby popping up, but I will figure out how to disable it eventually."
2,"This phone has some great features, but if it is broken, it is worthless. After 3 other smartphones that were easy to protect with cases and screen protectors, this one was difficult. What the dealer doesn't tell you is that the edge screen is so fragile that dropping it just one time will break it. That being said, it is hard to find a case that will protect the edge. It is also hard to find a screen protector made of glass that will fit properly and give the same touch ability. They should stress that you MUST have insurance. And then you probably will have to pay a service fee. The camera is great, storage great, battery life so so. Don't count on Bixby to be reliable. It doesn't always come up when you want it to and sometimes starts talking when the phone is sitting idle. If it had a flat screen I would recommend it, but not with the edge. Never again."
5,"Was getting irritated with my iPhone running out of space. No more. Galaxy to the rescue. Now I have the same amount of apps, photos, and music on my device plus more and haven't even touched half of the space."
5,"While I loved my S7, the new S8 is better. Better quality camera, glass display, speed, and ease of use make this new upgrade well worth it! The camera is incredible!"
5,"I upgraded to this from my Note 4. It's about the same thing but with better specs all around. I would necessarily say this is worth upgrading if you have a working phone. But if you're in need of an upgrade, this is a great choice. I'm still not 100% on board with the curved edges, but everything else is up to par."
5,This phone is much better then the 7 and sound and screen are nice.
5,Got two of the galaxy s8 over the weekend and love it
4,"Cool phone, but do not like the edge screen it to hard to type if you have big hands."
5,"I've never used such a beautiful phone before. Had it for almost a month and no issues so far. I love when the bevels light up for notifications. Camera is great, although sometimes struggles with capturing the contrast between sky and ground (but all phone cameras seem to struggle with that). No regrets!"
5,I upgraded from the S6 to S8 and don't regret it at all. The S8 has been all that it has lived up to everything you hear about the product. The phone was purchased for my son and he does everything that you can do with the phone. So if he is happy with it says a lot.
5,"Slim, light, excellent display and camera. Better than Apple"
5,"Finally got my new phone, I've been waiting for a new product that I can love. So many features for the galaxy 8..still learning..but really enjoying so far."
5,My brother LOVES his new 8. He said pretty much every feature is better than the 7 he just had
5,We got the new S8 for my wife. Her S4 was shot. She is enjoying the new phone. Everything works as it should. The call quality is very nice and the screen looks great. The phone is very fast.
2,Best Buy promotes the coral blue and with the case but it wasn't available in the store and they don't compensate in any way. It took two hours to buy this phone and transfer data from old phone. The guy was new and was getting no help from the other workers milling around. As far as the phone..not everything auto rotates. Messenger doesn't have the pinch feature to increase font size. Finding what your looking for in settings is frustrating.
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,old phone died all of a sudden. found out that they are only designed to last a couple years. don't know if this is any better. don't know yet.
5,"Upgraded my (Verizon) phone from an S6 and I haven't been sorry.
My carrier didn't have any incentives in any of their locations or online but Best Buy sure did! They also have a Samsung pro on site that facilitated my upgrade. Great Best Buy service and great Samsung service."
1,"I dropped my s8 while pulling it out of my pocket, screen shattered so bad it is not usable. Two repair shops quoted $330 for screen replacement plus a two week wait. (i guess samsung cant get enough screens shipped out fast enough) I only had the phone for 34 days. The interweb is full of s8 owners who have had the same problem. If you dont mind the extra $330 a month, it is a fantastic phone."
4,"Decided to switch from Apple. This is a huge upgrade from my iPhone 6. The phone is a bit tall and even with my long fingers it can be hard to reach the top. I haven't found an email app that I like as much as Apple email. Other than that, I really like it. Having a full keyboard is great. Screen is incredible. Definitely takes some getting used to as I have never used an Android device before. So far, I'm glad I switched!"
5,"I never had a Samsung phone before; however, did have an iPhone for some time.The Galaxy S8 is a huge upgrade. You can customize so many different features on the phone, and I still learn something new each day. The camera takes excellent photos and the fingerprint scanner's location is not as bad as everyone ""thinks"" it might be. The only con I have about the phone is the inability to put it to sleep (or turn the screen off) without letting the screen time out or by pressing the side power button once. I just installed the new update and it has definitely made the infinity screen even more amazing. There is also a Bixby feature. I am still a little skeptical about Bixby, so I haven't really been using it. I didn't have an S7, so I can't speak for those who want immediate upgrades, but if you have the version before that I would highly recommend upgrading. Even if you're an iPhone user who wants a change, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great phone.

If you have any questions about the phone, feel free to ask!"
5,Had the phone for about 2 months now and they work great.
5,Had the phone for about 2 months now and they work great.
5,"The product was fine, the individual that helped me didn't seem very detail oriented or sure of what he was doing."
5,I bought this phone as part of my transition to the Google ecosystem. The phone works great.
2,"Really wanted to love this phone... The design is beautiful and the camera is beyond fantastic, but the cons outweigh the pros. 
1. Microphone/speaker is absolute garbage - I don't have Bluetooth in my car and rely heavily on the quality of the speaker. Though it was good for playing music, every call I was on the person on the other end could not hear a word I said and I ended up having to use the cell handheld, not so safe. 
2. Sound/Silent modality - I couldn't easily figure out how to have timer alarm go off when the phone was on silent/vibrate mode.
3. No Good Accessories - I ordered about 10 different screen protectors and cases off of Amazon from reputable companies and none seemed to work with the phone.
4. Battery life - battery was generally great, except for when using GPS, then the battery drained within a few hours.

It's just not as great as I expected it to be, my disappointing purchase turned into a return (better pay a restocking fee than continue paying for an impractical phone)."
5,"This is the best phone available. If you want to know what two iPhones from now will be like, get this."
5,"I went back to Samsung after having a Motorola and I am so glad I did. This phone has a great picture, and is so easy to use. Love it!!"
5,"Picked up a second S8 for our account - Best Buy had it on sale and it was almost half of the price I paid at product launch, The S8 has an excellent battery which lasts over a full day with medium usage. Display is awesome!"
5,"It fast, beautiful and sleek. It has so many features and works amazingly. My daughter has it and dropped and it hasn't damaged yet. I did buy a case and screen protector which I highly recommend doing with that scree."
5,"Another nice case for a phone, sturdy and like the color."
5,I think the Galaxy S8 is a great phone. It's even better than I heard. I've only had it for a few weeks so I'm still learning all the features. I'm extremely pleased with the phone!
5,"enjoy the phone, very clear and camera is excellent. like the expandable feature over the I phone."
5,Great Phone with Great Pictures. Battery Last forever
5,Takes time to get used to but similar to s8. Good pictures
2,"Overall all I like the phone but the bluetooth connection is horrible. I have 3 devices (powerbeats2, bluetooth speaker, and my vehicle) that my S5 worked very well with. Since switching to the S8, all 3 devices now have horrible connections. The bluetooth range is horrible with my speaker and headphones when further than 5 feet from the device. When calling people from my truck, the person I am calling only hears static and I only hear complete silence on my end. The truck is a brand new 2017 and there were no connection problems between my S5 and the truck. I returned to the store and they exchanged the S8 for a new one, however the new S8 is doing all the same things. I will be returning the phone and checking out other brands."
5,"This phone is the best so far, enjoy using , whit no problems"
5,This phone is awesome. It will text and make phone calls. Huge nut bust!
5,"I love the pictures this phone take, it's awesome, so neat clear doesn't it matter if inside is dark."
5,great phone and WONDERful customer service! I love that they helped me set it all up with no problems.
5,Smooth and fast. I love it. This is my tool for business.
5,"Glad I purchased this phone. My Droid mini (after 2 years) was slow... This phone is much faster, display is excellent, and even though Samsung features are slightly different than Moto, it was an easy switch."
5,"I upgraded from a Galaxy s5, and this phone has a ton of great new features, along with a sleek interface. Definitely would recommend!"
4,"Upgraded to the 8 from a 6. It has a lot of the same features so it was easy to adjust to. Like the smart transfer feature. Good phone overall, the only complaint is the battery. Have to charge it every night. :-("
5,"This phone it great! The call clarity, ease of use, battery life and look feel are all wonderful. The on gripe I have besides the obvious poor placement of the fingerprint scanner (right next to the camera...seriously) is the weird screen aspect ratio. The tall thin phone screen often places vertical bars on either side of the viewable screen when I'm watching a movie or video in landscape mode. What's the point of the ""infinity screen"" if you're no using all of that space. Also, the curved edges of the phone can sometimes make it hard to use a horizontal scroll on a webpage or use some video player features because the scroll bar and buttons are displayed on the curved edge in landscape mode and don't always pick up your finger presses. Overall this is a great looking and performing phone but these two minor issues can be annoying."
5,"Was in need of new phone. Still had a s4. The s8 is great, easy to use and tons of features"
4,"It's dandy! I am very happy with the screen. It is easier to use. I can customize the product more to my liking, and it is durable. All good things."
5,"Fast, beautiful design. Not bogged down with bloatware. Apps that work."
5,"This was to replace my wife's S3. Aside from the normal learning curve and annoyance of having to set things up, this phone is VERY nice. Great camera, good battery life and wireless charging were great features but the kicker was the price! Thank you Best Buy!"
5,I love how easy this phone is to use and how much you can personalize it to suit how what you want at your fingertips.
5,It is all anyone would want in a phone. It does it all.
5,The UI and camera are a nice improvement over the S6.
5,Upgraded from an S6 and have found the S8 to be a big improvement.
5,Wife loves it. Enough said. Close to the Edge that was her favorite.
5,Great phone. Love the storage and screen resolution. Curved edges cause an inadvertent button touch once in a while but have gotten used to it.
5,My first phone that is the most current version. Lovely screen and very good looking pics and videos. Works well with no problems so far.
4,Great quality all around. Screen size and quality is great. Picture quality is fantastic.
5,"What can I say? This android smart phone is the best I've own and on the market, to-date. The phone displays a crisp picture and produces good sound for such a small device. The camera takes unbelievable pictures. Oh...and it has an awesome battery life, too!"
5,Only complaint is trying to find case and screen cover
5,Pretty easy to use. Love the speed. More apps to use too
5,"Like most everyone today, I have used several varieties of smartphones over the years (Iphones, LG's, Moto,). I am really impressed with the quality of the S8 and the overall pleasure I get from using it. Everything feels seamless and the display is gorgeous!

I understand that the phone is covered in a glass coating, so I bought a wallet case that keeps the entire phone covered when not in use. I'm not a huge user of the fingerprint scanner and I don't even care to try bixby, so I can't really comment on those aspects. 

I enjoy the customization of Android and the S8 is the cream of the crop in the Android market. My wife has an iphone 7, which is a fantastic phone, but with the screen, headphones, and android functionality, I feel the s8 is a superior device."
5,"I'm really loving this phone. I like having a bigger screen than my old phone but it's still easy to hold. I have have small hands and some of the bigger phones are difficult for me to use one handed, but not this one. The beautiful, high resolution screen is easy on my eyes. Runs fast and smooth."
5,This is my 4th galaxy phone. The features keep getting better and the picture quality is amazing even in low light. Perfect size and holds the charge all day!
5,"Great phone, nice upgrade from GS6. Battery life is good, phone is her responsive. The 4k screen is beautiful. No complaints, just wanting a nice glass screen protector. So far no one makes a full adhesive protector."
5,I am so pleased that I purchased this phone. It is easy to maneuver and has an excellent camera. I love everything Samsung!
5,This is a continuation of a great product. The phone looks great and in your hand it just seems to fit perfectly. The camera is easy to use and the pictures look great. There is so much that you can do with this phone that it is a little overwhelming. I love it.
5,"Love this new phone. It does all things well, and with minimal battery use. At the end of a day busy with calls, texts, and reviewing email, it still retains over have it's battery capacity. The display is crystal clear, and enlarged with the wrap around screen."
4,"I Love it
Team Android
Works great and I Love the advancements"
5,Decided to upgrade from a S5 and it is so much faster it is really nice. Bought two that day and an Apple 7. Screen is fantastic and everything exceeds what I want it for.
4,"Love the full screen interface! Its got good weight and even without a case it's grippy enough to not slip out your hand that easy like the aluminum back phones. The speaker is surprisingly loud and it takes beautiful pictures, even pointed at the clouds! Time will tell if any quirks or flaws pop up like my previous phone, you know how this game goes."
5,This is the second of two Galaxy S8 phones purchased. My wife loves it. It's a larger screen than the old Galaxy S4's we had but much better quality images and having a little larger screen is great. We've had no problems with either phone and would definitely buy again. Glad we waited so long for upgrade because this is a great phone.
5,Takes a little getting used to new OS because of upgrade from the old Galaxy S4 but overall I'm very happy with the phone. I thought the curved edges might be a problem but I've experienced no issues with anything accidentally happening when touch the edge.
5,the best phone I had so far. still need to get used to it
5,"Switch back from iphone again cz my iphone 6s got crash screen 3 times in a row during past half year. S8 is durable and solid build! Much better than.iphone(I throw away my phone occasionally) the result is s8 survived but iphone broke everytime. Good speed, okay battery, nice design"
4,"I've been a loyal Samsung customer for several years now and love this phone. Coming from the S7 Edge, this phone is thinner, lighter, and not so bulky. I originally got the S8+ and it ended up being too big, so I exchanged it. I shouldn't need to use 2 guy sized hands to hold the phone at times. Battery life is pretty good, a little better than the S7. I have the orchid gray one, looks gray, blue, silver, and light purple at times. Who picks the colors for these phones, anyway?? 
Anyway, the camera is amazing, it is fast and call quality is really good. I'd definitely recommend."
5,Had a s6 before this. Can honestly say Samsung outdid themselves again. Great battery life and very fast. Couldn't ask for a better phone because I don't know what they could improve on
4,Over time I'm hoping the Samsung galaxy S8 becomes a five star product. It obviously has a glorious screen and features galore. I'm apprehensive about the durability of the screen based on other reviews. I'll update my post in six months or so.
5,Best phone Samsung has made. Ease of use and great camera.
5,Love this phone! Still exploring all the features. Great camera and easy to use. Love the screen size. Battery life is good.
5,like it but still learning about all it does in time will say more
5,"This phone is light years ahead of my Tracfone. I having been playing Pokemon GO and doing all kinds or texting, taking pix, Love it, love it, love it!"
5,"I wanted to upgrade my Samsung S5. Wow, what a change. I love the bigger screen, the clarity of the picture. This was a great purchase."
4,"I love the phone. It's much better than my Galaxy S5. However, the curved glass, which looks nice, is a terrible feature. I had the phone two days, and it is very thin. I put it in my back pocket and sat down on a chair and cracked the glass. The cost to replace the glass is $415.00. The phone cost $725.00. I'm so disappointed in the design. I would give the phone five stars if it wasn't for this curved glass which will lead to cracks. I want on several Samsung Galaxy S8 forums and there are thousands of people complaining about the glass cracking. I am going to ""recommend"" the phone to a friend with the caveat ""be careful"" with the glass and get a case that complete covers the front of the phone, and there aren't many cases out there that do."
4,"I really like this phone! The screen is incredible-both clear and large. The headphones that come with it are outstanding quality. The multiple security options are pretty impressive, albeit almost too much. I had heard some negative things regarding the Bixby assistant software, but I think it works well. My only knock on it so far is the back casing being pretty scratch prone. Haven't had the phone long and it shows some of the hairline scratches. I'm now in the market for a protective case when I'd hoped to not need one (thinking purely for condition for trade in value). Overall, I would have no hesitation buying this phone over and over again. Samsung has stepped up their game once again."
3,Phone screen cracked when in my pocket. I should have read the reviews that said it was very easy to crack.
5,I am enjoying my new Samsung Galaxy S8. It feels so sleek.
5,"I am very happy with my new Samsung S8, which I recently upgraded from the S7. Overall, the slimmer width fits better in the hand. The screen resolution is even better than the S7."
5,"I had a Samsung Galaxy S5 before this one so I'm use to the android phones. I am really enjoying the Samsung Galaxy S8. Love the feel, love the color and everything about it."
5,Works great. Nice upgrade from the iPhone. Samsung any day
5,"Great screen, amazing camera, tons of options, and battery life has been great"
4,Samsung's best phone yet. Has some really great features like Bixby.
5,We have had no problem with this phone. He absolutely has loved it.
5,"Upgraded to this phone after having a S6. This one is so much faster and the screen is amazing. Camera takes great photos, especially of landscapes. Happy with it overall"
5,The S8 is a great phone and easy to use. The new features are very cool.
5,Picture quality is incredible. Best phone yet. Buy one.
3,"had a radio station app on my S4 that was transferred to the S8. The app doesn't work right on the S8 and Samsung rep says ""can't do anything about that, have the app people fix it"". hard to turn on by pressing on screen front but otherwise everything works good."
4,"Great camera good sound quality.
Like the size bixby is cool"
5,"I love this phone!!! It does everything, more efficient than the Iphone for sure."
4,Replaced my old S5 that finally crapped out. Phone is awesome. The display takes up the entire screen which is a real bonus. Phone also retains a headphone jack as it is my primary music device. Camera produces great photos with very good call clarity. My only complaints are the fingerprint scanner is next to the camera lens in the back of the camera (poor design) and the face recognition rarely works.
5,"I didn't know what I was missing with my Galaxy S5, but the new Galaxy S8 is awesome! This battery fully charges in 1 to 2 hours, and it lasts for 2 days or more with normal use. Even if I take a lot of photos and watch videos, it easily lasts 24 hours. It's so nice to have 64 GB of RAM built-in (plus a micro SD slot for expanded memory, which I use for my photos & videos). It allows me to run lots of apps at the same time without slowing down the phone at all. The new retinal scanner is nice, because I can unlock my phone in a public place without anyone seeing my unlock pin or pattern (and it only works with my own eyes). Very cool phone!"
5,"Love the big screen, fairly new so just learning things about it. So far, best phone yet. Camera is crazy good!"
5,I enjoy using my new s8 every day it is sleek stylish and feels great in my hand
5,Does a lot more than the previous model. Easy to activate to current number.
5,"Great phone, nice camera easy to use would recommend."
5,"High quality phone, the battery is much better then I expected and it charges very fast."
5,"This is not my first Samsung smartphone, but it sure is the best one. Beautiful screen; easy to hold in my hand; very responsive to touch. 
I really like the ability to add an sd card in order to upgrade the memory. 
I was able to purchase during a Bestbuy sale, so I saved over $300 versus purchasing the exact same phone directly from my carrier. 
I could not be happier with my purchase."
5,So far im impressed with the speed and all the features it has. Still working on Bixby... but im sure when i get the hang of it... i will onjoy it very much.
5,Got the s8 for 420 after 300 dollar off deal. Great phone and a great price what more could you want.
5,I needed to upgrade my phone and based on reviews I bought the S8.
5,The phone has a great screen great features I only bought the 8 I should of bought the 8+ I went from a note 5 I love this phone
5,I was used to using a Motorola cellphone and after switching to the Galaxy S8 I was able to use it without any problem. Love the S8.
5,Ghe Samsung Galaxy S8 is za fantastic phone. I bought it from Best Buy because it was $200 cheaper than from Verizon. Did not need to add a line to get this price.
5,I just upgraded from the S6. The user interface and visiblr software does not differ from the S6 much. I love the look and feel of the phone.
5,My husband recently upgraded his phone from the S6 and is absolutely loving it!!
5,"Time for an upgrade, and going from the S6 to the S8 was a fantastic choice! Still getting used to some of the minor changes, but loving it so far..."
5,"Really like this phone. My wife and I upgraded to the Galaxy 8+ and the Galaxy 8. Two days later Best Buy ran the new special at $300 less per phone. Yep, we visited Best Buy and they helped us through the return and new purchase process, with a smile. Cesar (in Bend) was very helpful and knowledgeable, typical of most of their staff."
5,This is a terrific phone still amazed by all that it can do.
5,Very impressed with this phone and I got a great deal.
3,"Camera is ok. Sony Xperia Z3V takes much clearer, detailed and sharper raw photos. Samsung display is nicer so photos appear to be better than it actually is."
5,Highly recommend. Great quality. Every Samsung phone I've owned has been fantastic and they keep improving.
5,I bought this to lower my payments but I've been pleasantly surprised and how much I am liking it right away.
5,"Amazing phone, average battery life, great camera, plenty of storage space for pictures!"
4,I love the new screen & that I can send pictures while on the phone. My old phone couldn't
5,An awesome product from Samsung.... Infinite screen is the best and i have seen an awesome product for the first time after samsung galaxy S.... Go for it
4,"The display is mesmerizing, not a huge fan of the virtual home button, but that's an easy thing to get used to."
5,Phone has great clarity. Easy to use and to set up. Nice feel to it. Great features.
5,Its my husband's and he is having fun with exploring the options. He is having a blast with this one.
5,"I am not good at operating phones to the max, but this one makes it easy for anyone to set up. Love it!"
3,This is my 3rd S8 already. Dropped and cracked screen on 2....so far.
5,"I have owned two other Galaxy phones and an HTC. All are similar to the user, even with various technical differences. But I went back to the Samsung. It is a beautiful phone, not difficult to use."
5,Great phone........................................
5,Great upgrade from my previous galaxy. Feels good to be up to date with technology again
5,I had the galaxy s5 before and this is a great upgrade from that
5,Very happy with the purchase. Would buy again. Definitely like the plus version
5,I have used this phone for 3 weeks so far and like it a lot. Upgraded from an S4 with only a few issues like contacts not transferring completely.
5,"I was a bit apprehensive about getting this phone at first but it's amazing. I Love the design and the screen. And the battery is great too, it usually lasts longer than 24 hrs"
5,"I think I'm really going to like this phone, once I figure out how to use it. I am a bit technically challenged these days. Came from an S4, so there is a lot to relearn."
5,The Samsung S8 has an amazing screen. It is super fast and love the new Bixby assistant feature.
4,I like my new phone but still learning how to operate it.
5,The Samsung S8 is great. Camera is greater then ever.
4,This is a good product and my daughter loves it. However the data usage soars after she has this phone. I hope there are some way to restrict the data usage on this phone.
5,"Very sleek, even with a case it fits nicely in my pocket. Very fast and a great screen resolution. Only down side is the height. I wear large gloves so I have slightly larger than average hand and I can't reach the whole screen while only using one hand. They used to try to make phones as small as possible, soon we'll all be carrying 30"" screens with us."
5,"great phone with a premium design. battery has been good so far, fingers crossed and everything has worked as expected."
5,Slim design disappears in my pocket. Great display. Good sound. Long battery life - have yet to get it below 50% in a long day of use. Charges fast. Always on display is nice. The only thing I don't like is the darn Bixby button I always seem to hit by mistake because of its location.
5,"This phone is as good as advertised. Brilliant display, great camera, fingerprint sensor, etc. I love it."
5,I really didn't want a new phone since my S7 edge was great but so far so good and the battery is great.
5,I really didn't want a new phone since my S7 edge was great but so far so good and the battery is great.
5,I love SAMSUNG phones and this S8 is better than the older one I had.
4,"This is an upgrade for my wife. Pleased thus far, battery life much better than earlier phones"
4,"Needed to upgrade my wife's ancient Samsung S3. I have an S7, and I was worried about some reviews of the S8's more delicate case glass (bought the extra warranty and a good case). The wife loves the speed of the phone, the battery life and the screen (I'm jealous too now!). 

The one knock is for the typical bloatware from both Samsung and Verizon (I'd throw in Google too, but their software is often helpful, unlike Bixby). Speaking of Bixby, I don't want to use it, and there's a dedicated button for it. It's a waste of a button, plus too close to the volume. Even if you disable Bixby, it still wakes up when you hit the button. It also intrudes on the camera screen too."
5,Overall a great phone. I like both the look and feel.
5,I've had this phone for 2 weeks now and I love it. The screen is amazing and the battery life is a huge upgrade over my Samsung S6. Would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great new phone.
4,Happy with the camera and apps. Glad I upgraded my phone.
5,Excellent phone with great features...just love it. Sleek & Sturdy
5,"Excellent phone with great features, absolutely love it!"
5,This phone is the greatest phone I have ever owned!
5,"It,s bigger than the S5 I'm replacing, which is nice. I love both cameras. It,s waterproof. I do worry about screen protection as it has a curved screen. It has ""Smart Switch"" to transfer contacts, pix, and doc, But, It didn't transfer everything. Great phone"
5,Super upgrade from the S6. The S8 has a really nice screen. Easy to hold. Good battery life.
5,upgraded from s4 (been waiting for cost to go down.) I'm till learning all the new features.
5,Absolutely love this phone. The screen is gorgeous. It is quick and powerful. Great deal from best buy. Better than what I can get from Verizon
5,Upgraded to the S8 from the S6. Not as bulky and the screen is not as wide. Rounded edge is different and takes a little time to adjust to the new feel.
5,Great camera and great battery life. Very fast at opening apps
4,"I got a great deal on this phone and am very happy with it. I love how smooth the screen is. I am still adjusting to the curved side. The battery life is good so far, and I absolutely love the camera. The main reason. I only gave 4 stars is because I wish the phone were a little wider. I had the S5 before this and I am missing how much wider it was. The face recognition doesn't work well for me."
5,Great phone! Picture quality is A+ and great battery life. The fast charge time is amazing. So glad I purchased the S8!
5,"This is the perfect phone with every feature anyone could expect on a phone, including a great camera."
5,They keep adding value added features and refining the old features that didn't work well. Solid phone.
4,"I am overall happy with the phone, pretty much has everything you would be looking for in a basic phone."
5,"The samsung galaxy s8 is an awsome phone, and takes great pictures. Highly recommended."
5,"Much improved visual appearance, easier to see, easier to read."
5,Jumping from the Samsung 6 to the new 8 was a great choice... the camera is amazing ... both single pix and videos are crystal clear
5,"Great phone, haven't dropped it in water yet, but it does everything a senior would need especially the camera, I love it!!"
5,"This S8 is pretty amazing....Great visibility, bright beautiful screen and screaming fast."
5,My son says it is the best Galaxy phone he has ever had!
5,I am glad that I upgraded. This phone is awesome and more advanced than my S3.
4,Awesome product...battery still lacks the longevity that I was promised it would.
5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an incredible phone and I would suggest it to anyone. Great battery life too.
5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an incredible phone and I would suggest it to anyone. Great battery life too.
5,"Great phone once you get used to it , except for the nine existing phone cases available in store , 50+ for the not so great iPhones but 2 for Samsung, really , so guess my money will go somewhere else for the case"
5,Has all the high tech you expect from a galaxy with a great battery life and not bulky at all. Awesome camera
5,It's a little bigger than my old phone but it's a lot nicer to look at I can
5,I finally decided to upgrade my dying S5 and I was not disappointed with the S8. I do enjoy the beautiful screen and it runs much smoother than my three year old phone. So far it has been great besides the usual Samsung quirks that I have experienced with all my Samsung phones.
5,"I love the battery endurance and quick charge. The sound quality is great, as are pictures. I had a Moto Z Droid that I did not like at all, turned it in for this S8. I am now very happy with my phone."
4,"I have just had my Galaxy S8 for two weeks. There are many things I like about the phone, such as the quality and features of the camera. The curved screen is, to me, not a good design. When there are items, icons, text, etc. that have to be touched that are on the edge of the screen, it can be difficult to have the item respond to touch. Also, moving an app shortcut from one page to another by holding a finger on it and sliding it can be difficult as when one gets to the edge, it often doesn't want to move to the adjacent screen. Also, I installed some files on the phone. As there was no 'Documents' or 'My Documents' folder. Samsung customer service advised to create a folder 'Documents' and I did and installed the files. A couple of days later, the files disappeared and a 'My Documents' folder appeared and I had to move files to the phone again. Also, a folder I installed doesn't show up when I access the documents, but the files and sub-folders do show up. Many of the functions of the phone have improved considerably over my former Galaxy Note 3."
5,So far I like it. Takes some time to get use to the home button. Not as bulky as the 7. Screen has got me a little worried but I'll just have to be careful with it.
5,Great step up from my old galaxy. Nice features and speed.
5,"I have had several Samsung phones, all great experiences. When I noticed my not-quite two year old S5 slowing down and really using up battery, I figured it was time to make the S8 mine. I did this on high recommendation from my 8th grade students who were, as usual, right on the tech money. I am thrilled with the battery life, ease of use, and overall operation of the S8. I'm so glad I made the purchase which I did right at Best Buy. I even got trade in credit from my S5. The Samsung crew at Best buy were super. All of my other Samsung purchases were at the Verizon brick store. Would definitely buy again."
5,Best phone ever!!! Easy to use and pictures are incredible. We have always preferred Samsung phones and this is no different. Many functions and easy to use! Everything works wonderful and love this phone!
5,"I am really loving this phone especially on the Verizon network. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S5 on Sprint and liked it but had no idea what I was missing. This phones camera, sound quality, display, different messaging features offered through Verizon are just phenomenal. I am so glad we decided to upgrade."
5,"I love this phone. It feels great, looks great and operates great!!"
5,The phone performs very well and is easy to use. The battery life is great.
5,This phone is so easy to use I just love it do glad my old phone was broke
5,nice phone A+ service Thanks...................................
5,"I previously had the S5 before upgrading. Love it! So fast, sleek, and big. Battery life is awesome too. And I got it at a great price."
5,"Most importantly, battery life is great. Lots of features. Great graphics."
5,My wife loves it and it costs less than the s7edge which she had before.
4,Excellent design with solid software. Bixby is a waste. Battery life is ok.
5,"Such a great phone and many upgrades since my S6. The screen is clear, the camera is incredible, the battery life is fantastic!"
5,love this phone. picture is great and the camera is amazing for a phone. Love that it is waterproof.
5,love this phone. picture is great and the camera is amazing for a phone. Love that it is waterproof.
5,"Great phone, great feel, great photos awesome all the way around"
5,"Bought as an upgrade for my mother. She has adapted to it well, no issues going from S4 to S8."
5,"Can't believe how quick the phone is, so much space, can't wait to see how good bixby is"
5,"Just left my S6 for this awesome new upgraded techy phone! Love the battery life, super fast processor and water proofness! Always been a android fan!"
5,"We had to get a new phone when our old one died before a big trip. Fortunately Verizon had backed up our apps and all the contacts with the groups so we were completely put back together after the salesman moved our SD card with all our pictures and some apps to the new phone. Another Samsung person at BestBuy had moved all our pictures and some apps, those that could be moved, to the mini SD card a few months ago. Hint: you have to use the file manager instead of Gallery to move the pictures and apps. Very happy with Verizon, BestBuy and Samsung"
5,This is the sleekest looking and overall best camera I have ever used. This phones display is amazing.
5,"Good battery life, lasts all day. The phone I had before didn't last half as long."
5,I was upgrading from a Galaxy S6 and the main reason was to get a phone with a better battery than the S6. Well this one is it! I usually had to charge my S6 more than once a day and so far with the S8 it has been lasting all day with one charge.
5,"Easy purchase through best buy.
Impressive phone voice quality and battery life. Glad I picked this up"
3,"The 12 mp rear camera and 8mp front camera are excellent. Battery life holds out strong, easy to use and set up, and has an excellent display. Although, I have some concerns. I purchased an Otterbox Defender case for it, since both the front and rear of the phone is glass. The glass gets easily smudged, and I don't feel confident holding the phone as if it'll slip out of my hand. I've read many reviews that without a strong case, the glass on either side of the phone could chip or break. The fingerprint sensor also takes a bit to work out, since it doesn't get my fingerprint quite right until a few more attempts.

Overall, it's a good phone but definitely buy a strong/durable case for it, or else it's prone to being chipped or cracked. The Bixby button also is annoying, since I accidentally press it a lot."
5,"I was worried at first about not having a home button, but got used to having it on the screen pretty quickly. I love the camera. It takes amazing pictures both front and rear facing. I also like having the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone."
5,great option for new phone upgrade and savings on my plan
5,"I love my new Galaxy S8! The camera features are great, very clear pictures and videos. The edge features are super easy to use too. I would encourage others to get this phone."
5,I had a Samsung Note 5 and this phone had almost the same size screen in a smaller package. Sharp pictures and images.
4,"Start by saying I got the S8 because I needed a new phone. I have had a galaxy since S3, which was my favorite version of this phone. S8 has made some great improvements. However, the ONE area that they (Samsung) have preached is Bixby. Yesterday (7/20/17) my Bixby FINALLY had a voice and can understand some basic voice inputs. The phone was released without Bixby fully functional that is the minus one star. Outside of that great phone! I would argue for most of us the phone is top-notch I just find it annoying it was released and not fully functional."
5,"Got this phone you my son. He loves his as much as I love mine. We got them together. He said it's the best Samsung phone he's had so far. Great quality, great color & graphics."
5,"I love this phone! The color & graphics are amazing! Crystal clear, bright color! Camera is also amazing, excellent pictures! And I love Bixby! She is so awesome!"
4,I would recommend this item. Go ahead and get it. Y
4,Good phone for my mother. She love android devices.
5,"It is the perfect phone for me. Long battery life, fast, i able to have more memory with sd card and it isn't an humungous device i have to lug around"
5,"Has so many bells and whistles that months after getting it, I am still finding cool new things about the phone!"
5,the galaxy 8 is the best phone ive had so far when it comes to cellphones
5,"I did6want to upgrade, glad I did, very nice phone"
4,"I have always been an iPhone guy. I was looking for a change of pace and dediced to give this phone a try. The design of this phone is fantastic. Large screen in a not so large phone. Very nice phone. On the other hand, if the new iPhone is basically the same design as the Galaxy I will be going back to Apple. I am a very simple guy. I like a simple phone. Simplicity and reliability are my two biggest wants. Android phones have way to many bells and whistles that I just don't need."
5,"Love my new Samsung Galaxy S8! I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 (yes, you read that right, the S3) to the new Samsung S8. HUGE upgrade for me. In all the years that I had owned the S3 (since 2012) I never had a problem it. So I knew that once the price dropped on the S8, I would purchase one. It was SO worth the wait! My new S8 is like a mini computer - crystal clear screen - takes great photos - and has so many awesome features. I've had it for a week and I can't seem to put it down. If you are on the fence - go for it. You won't be disappointed!"
4,I like the phone because it is easy to use and has a ton more memory than my previous phone.
5,"Its the new S8 that my daughter got for 16th birthday. My wife got the 8+ a few months back and as equally impressed. Love the Samsung pay and the camera. Finally no more physical home button. Its a beautiful screen but hate that screen is over exposed and screen protectors have a hard time staying on. All glass to needs a case, though I am watching shows on Drama Fever and no one uses a case (for promotional purposes) but still. The Flip case does a nice job of protecting screen when not in use but still vulnerable when being used."
2,"Screen is not consistently sensitive with the protective glass on. Also appears to be less sensitive on the edges. Didn't like the Google Play app for my music so I downloaded the Samsung app. Has a tendency to drop a public radio app I like to listen to, and bluetooth connection to car is inconsistent - occasionally turns off the bluetooth. Have had to contact Samsung several times to get help. They have been very helpful. Best Buy folks have also been helpful. Bright, clear screen. Haven't played much with Bixby. Biometric (Iris and thumbprint) login work well."
5,"Wife wanted a galaxy S8. She's absolutely in love with it. I'm an iPhone guy myself, but it works for her and what she does for work."
5,Couldn't beat the deal!!! A great phone at a great price from a great store!!
4,Have been very happy with this phone so far. It's a big step up from the S5.
5,Glad they upoed the storage! And is now water proof
5,"Getting to know the S8 since I upgraded from S4
I do not like the 1st screen always showing. Volume for not high enough for people to head me very well."
5,"The display is beautiful, it's everything I could ever want in a phone"
4,"Great phone with nice screen and resolution and good camera, but phone locked up on me within first two days requiring soft reboot. (Had to find out how to reboot on line and found several others are having similar issues.) Hopefully, it won't happen again. Great price at Best Buy and good service to get old phone transferred over and new phone up and running."
5,I would definitely recommend this phone and I'm buying another one to add on my plan!
5,"Love my new Samsung phone! Sleek, shiny, sophisticated. Very user friendly and fast, too!"
4,I traded 7 edge camera is better but nothing else is that exciting. Good phone so far
5,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, it is also a plus that BestBuy offers the ""Samsung Experience"" within the store. This makes it so efficient if there are any questions about the product."
5,"Very happy with this phone, quite the upgrade from a S5."
5,"This was purchased for my son after his S6 died one month shy of 2 years old. He loves this phone with all of its new features (such as the Edge, always on display, retinal scan, Bixby, and expansion SD slot) and improved performance and camera. Movies don't look like they are on a phone, more like a tiny 4K television. Solid construction and flawless operation. Great phone!"
5,Love the phone it is exactly what I want great product
5,I love the galaxy s8. It charges fast and has better reception. Photos are great! Easy to get to know. I loved my S7 but I love this more!
3,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a very good-looking phone. It operates well so I have no complaints about its operation. However, I see some shortcomings in its design a prospective buyer should consider. Yes, these are not very serious complaints but they are, nonetheless annoyances I hadn’t considered when I bought the phone. 

The curved edges of the display work poorly with the tempered glass protectors I’ve used. Rather than gluing the entire tempered screen protector to the phone’s screen, the screen protector has its glue applied only to its perimeter. This means that moisture can get between the protector and the screen and the glue-line is visible when looking at the screen’s edge. This also makes the phone is less responsive to touch in some areas of the screen because of the inconsistent air gap between the screen and protector. Furthermore, the screen isn’t protected as well at the curved edges because a protective case must allow you to see the side of the screen. This lack of edge protection allowed a short drop to shatter the phone’s screen when the very edge hit the ground. 

The lack of a home key makes determining which end of the phone is up more difficult. Yes, you can see the camera and speaker are at the top but it takes more than a casual glance at the phone to figure things out. 

I regret trading in my Galaxy S6 and getting the S8."
5,"As I get used to the S8, I find that I am liking it much better than the S5 I had before. The Samsung reps in the store were very helpful in transferring the data from my old phone."
5,We bought this phone for our daughter and she is delighted with the speed compared to her Galaxy S6.
5,"I have now been a Samsung convert for several generations, starting with the S5. This is a sleek, well-designed phone. Very responsive. I love the camera and the ability to have DSLR like controls. I am always amazed at the quality of low light pictures this camera can take."
5,This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. Very easy to use
5,I was well behind and overdue for an upgrade. Screen resolution and picture quality is great. Wasn't sure I would use edge feature but find use all the time. Fast charging is awesome and battery life is long. A bit getting used to the change for no home button to an on screen one and different way to close all apps. Took A few days to get used to new features. Have to remind myself went from an S3 to S8 plus. S3 finally died which prompted purchase- glad went to S8 plus over other phones. Overall very pleased with purchase.
4,Love it. Upgraded from the Samsung S6 so glad made that decision.
5,Lightweight and easy to use. good camera and clear images
5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 phone is a magnificent upgrade from my S4 phone. Only have to recharge phone every 2 days instead of twice a day. Having fun learning the new features, and there are so many good ones."
5,Love this phone and it's features. It keeps a charge all day!
5,I debated between the S8 and S8+. I decided on the S8 because of the smaller size and the ease of use with my small hands. Easy transition from my old phone.
5,This S8 is just the right size for my hand. I can finally reach across the screen with my thumb to tap an application icon. The screen resolution is amazing. I've used Samsung for many years... this is the best one yet!
5,"First phone for a kid, couldn't have been a better choice out there. Includes the best buy card worth 250 bucks, perfect."
5,Best phone I have ever used. Battery life is great and the screen is amazing. I must own. Of course best buy also had the best deals and promotions. Ty again for awesome customer service.
4,This phone is excellent. Like the curved screen. Great deal st best buy.
3,Not much new in the phone. It's overpriced. The features are almost same as earlier versions and other android competitors have cheaper phone with similar features
5,Hi I am highly recommended for the use of s8 please purchase it from bestbuy as they are the best.
3,"It's is a good phone but the glass for the top was not good. I couldn't text or hit any of the buttons, I tore it off I hope they come out with a better one soon"
5,This is the best phone I have ever had! I haven't had any problems with it at all!
5,"The picture came out very sharp & clear, unlike IPhone. Design is very slick. Love it."
5,I switched from Apple iPhone to Samsung about a year ago now and I've never looked back. First the S7 and now this S8. The S8 is hands down the best phone I've ever owned and in my opinion the best phone for sale out there. Plus it was cheaper per month than my S7! This phone is IT.
5,Vary happy with it. I had s6 before and this one is much faster and clearer screen
5,"I love this S8 galaxy, it has the best screen. The camara is first rate. I've had a minor problem with Wi-Fi disconnects after ther last updated. Overall it's the best phone I have used."
5,I upgraded from my old Note 5. What an upgrade...slim..sleek...Gorilla Glass 5... read the reviews on how hard this phone is to break... always on display.... battery life is almost as good as the much larger Note 5. The only thing I noticed is that the range of the Bluetooth is somewhat less than the Note 5.
5,My S8 has a lot of wonderful features. Love it!! Use it everyday!
5,Love all the new features. So easy to understand all setups.
5,I discover something new everyday. Great phone!!!!
5,Bought this phone as an upgrade from the Galaxy S5. I love the picture quality of the camera feature. Having the edge option doesn't matter much to me but the overall size and design of the phone fits my needs perfectly.
5,"Bought it for my son, he is happy no ploblems at all."
5,"I LOVE this phone, I upgraded from a s5 to s8 and am glad I did.after a few adjustments I was set to go..the battery is so much better and lasts..the camera is awesome..the phone is pricey but well worth it !!"
5,"I have always been fond of Samsung phones. They can do almost everything your computer, camera, and gps can do and all in the palm of your hand. The S8 is a great example! It takes amazing pictures in the day as well as at night! The screen is amazing for watching any type of videos!"
5,The photos this camera captures is flawless. The quality is great and out offers different filters.
5,I decided to purchase the Samsung S8 phone. So far the phone has worked very well. It is fast and the screen is much larger than my old phone - great
5,"I had a s5 and upgraded to the s8. I was worried about not having the physical home button, but I like this better. Great phone!"
5,Fast n get service from the best buy employees. Phone is better
5,It's as good as advertised and the photos blow the iPhone out of the water
5,This phone is a great upgrade from the S7. All the features are amazing to include the larger screen.
5,Great phone. Works fast. Battery lasts longer than expected.
5,Nice sleak design. Phone works great. Would highly recommend this phone to everyone that wants a fast reliable phone. A+ from me!
5,Easy to use durable and great technology. Phone also constantly updates and has apps that provide day to day trackers and reminders.
5,This phone has all the features I was looking for.
5,"I've had this phone for awhile now and it has been everything that I have wanted in a phone, thank you for all of your help in my purchase."
5,It's awesome! I really enjoy this product and really cute colors!
5,Switched from iPhone 6 to samsung. Have more customization options and the Bluetooth connects to my car with out an issue.
5,I get excellent call quality and no navigation lag that I can tell. It is slim and fits anywhere
4,"I bought the Silver Galaxy S8 for myself and liked it so much, I went back 2 days later and bought the pink for my wife. She likes it just as much as I do."
4,"I really love the Galaxy S8 phone. The interface is quick and the performance has been great. Battery life has been very good even when listening to music and working out with the screen on the whole time. Bixby voice still doesn't work, but is launching shortly, o hopefully that will make this phone even better."
4,"I like the phone. Size wise, this was as big as I was going to go. Many phones were bigger and I think some of those would be like holding a laptop up to your ear. I put a cover on the phone to protect the edges, I guess I don't want to find out how strong the glass is. As far as factory software and apps are concerned, there is some good stuff. I prefer Android and I like this version. I don't care for the Bixby. Maybe it'll grow on me. Overall, this was a good choice for me."
5,"Phone is great all around. Only complaints are that the Samsung UI is a little limiting and has a decent amount of bloatware. Also, the IR remote present in previous Samsung phones was removed. I know not a lot of people use this, but I really enjoyed being able to have full control over my home entertainment system with my phone."
5,"Battery life is great , just turn off always on display. Still getting the hang of Bixby, waiting for it to be refined. Touch response is excellent display is beautiful. Glad I waited until this version of the Galaxy to try Samsung."
4,I like the look of this phone but I don't like the curved screen. The areas around and beyond the curved don't register your touch very well.
5,"The phone is simply amazing. Size, battery, camera... amazing"
5,Great phone - love the look and ease of use. Now can use apps that my old phone did not have
5,"Samsung's Galaxy S8 is an easy phone to use and enjoy. The camera is outstanding. If you previously owned a Samsung, you will find the S8 has upgraded features, apps, etc. It charges quickly. Once you become a Samsung phone owner, you happily will stay with Samsung!"
5,Love this phone. Looks great. Very intuitive. I would buy another.
5,I love this phone! I've had a Samsung phone for years - and I am really loving the Galaxy 8. The infinity screen is a game changer for sure...my favorite Samsung yet!
5,"Upgraded from an S6 what an improvement. The screen is amazing, video quality is awesome, camera takes great pictures both front and rear cameras. Sound quality is very good. Awesome phone so far."
5,"I've had This phone just over a week and it has so many awesome features, I'm still learning them. It has a beautiful display and looks really sharp. Can't wait to dig into it some more! Samsung Galaxy phones are the best!"
4,I like the slim design; it's easy to slip it into a pocket.
4,"So far we enjoy our new phones. The facial recognition technology is neat, but it doesn't work in the dark and you need to have a backup entry password."
5,"Purchased the new Samsung Galaxy S8, love it, still getting it figured out tho ,"
5,"I love my phone! My daughter and husband also got one. I usually hate upgrading my phone because it takes me a while to get used to a new one. But the people at Best Buy answered all my questions and made my experience even better! It has faster internet, Great calling features, etc!"
5,"I love this phone! It is so much better than any other phone I have had in the past. The people at Best Buy were extremely helpful, too! I would definitely recommend this phone."
3,"I've had my Samsung Galaxy S8 for about a week and a half, and have already experienced problems with Bluetooth. It's not a problem I've seen in any reviews of the product, yet apparently it is a known problem for which Samsung has yet to provide a fix. If Bluetooth is important to you, you SHOULD NOT buy this phone until you find that Samsung has fixed the problem. Or prepare to waste a lot of your time doing tricks to coax your phone into working properly.

Yes, the edge is beautiful. Yes, the display is bright and clean. Yes, it has tremendous storage space. Yes, it takes wonderful photos. Yes, it does a lot of neat stuff that I haven't really figured out yet, since I've only had the phone a short time. Yes, it is hands-down the coolest-looking phone I've ever owned.

But I wish I had my old phone (Galaxy S5) back. The S8's unreliable Bluetooth is aggravating. For a few hundred dollars less, maybe I wouldn't be so aggravated. 

I'll happily change this review, once I'm satisfied that my Bluetooth will work. For now, I'll expand on what I said earlier: It's a lot of money to pay for a smartphone whose basic features don't function properly."
5,The battery on this last almost all day. I am in IT and am on my phone almost all day and the battery still is above 40%.
5,This phone is better than my previous Samsung phone in every way. It has every feature that anyone could possibly need on a phone. And the camera takes GREAT pictures.
5,"Love the vibrate screen, camera si the best ive seen on a smartphone and the battery life is crazy. I can go all day and still have battery left. The quality of the phone is amazing!"
5,This phone is the bomb. The pictures are great. The screen is clear and it feels nice in your hand. Not too large.
5,"Only got this phone a week ago but already pleased with it. Battery life is excellent, good feel, quality, voice and camera. Honestly haven't done much with it thus far but I like Android and Samsung so I expect a good experience. Folks at Best Buy were very knowledgeable and someone from Samsung was in the store and helpful too."
5,"Samsung has done it again with it's latest smartphone. The screen is incredible, battery life is amazing and it's very fast running apps. Did I mention the camera is phenomenal!"
5,I had a S3 before and I love my S8 with all the extras added on in this phone.
5,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S3. BIG difference in battery life! Big improvement over my old phone. Still learning all the new features, but really impressed so far!"
4,My favorite camera so far. Lots of features to play with.
4,My favorite camera so far. Lots of features to play with.
4,This is a very easy to use version. Very intuitive to make learning easy
5,Very good. Much good. Always good. Give me my points
4,good phone))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
4,"Before this phone I had only owned iPhones. This is my first galaxy phone so I am adjusting to the differences. I think the photos are the best part. It takes really clear flattering photos. I got this phone instead of the IPHONE 7 and am very happy with my decision. However I don't like that you have to pay to subscribe for non spam calls and a I miss iTunes. Next phone I get in 2 years or so will most likely be an IPhone, but for now this works for what I need it for and is still an attractive smart phone that takes fantastic photos."
5,"Fast, great display, good sound. Have had no issues, and the battery life is great too. 
I had a screen protector on it, but even the expensive ones really reduced the sensitivity of the screen. Took it off and it's back to great."
5,I absolutely love this phone. Aweskme features and the edges are quite useful.
5,Great phone. Easy to use. Camera is awesome. Love the fingerprint
5,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S8. It is the best Samsung phone I have owned so far, and I've had the S4 and S5. It can be used by a smartphone veteran or someone new to smartphones or Samsung. The style with the beveled edge, while I thought was going to be annoying, is actually super handy. It's amazing what no edges does. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,"Purchased this phone for Mom because I liked that it has a large, very easy to read font. She loves it."
5,Like the thinness and curved edges. Like the quality of the phone.
5,Purchased for my son. He really likes the camera. Best phone he's had.
5,My husband loves his phone. He really likes the camera.
5,"I have had it only three weeks but love it. Had the S5 before and this is way faster. Camera is awesome. Speed speed speed. Great phone so far, love it."
5,The phone is so much faster and easier to use. It has a lot more stuff in it to be able to use. It's also very much faster.
5,Love the it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Performs as needed. Overall a good phone..

 ..."
5,Love this phone! Much faster than my last and so many features that makes me extremely happy
5,This phone runs flawlessly with no system issues to mention.
5,Samsung has improved on its already great Galaxy phones with this one.
5,I am very pleased with this Galaxy S8. I am enjoying learning its capabilities. BIXBY is OK so far but I look forward to getting BIXBY voice at some point.
5,I really like this phone. Display looks great and the phone performs nice.
5,"Phone looks, works great. I always get samsung phones"
5,As usual great phone by samsung and very sleek looking
5,"I really like this phone. It has a lot of nice features including the ""edge""."
5,This is actually my wife's phone but she really loves her new Galaxy S8. The functionality and quality upgrade from her old Galaxy S6 is amazing. Vivid quality of pictures and videos is a nice improvement.
4,"My perspective is based on being an early adopter for the S6 Edge +. I was really looking for something a little smaller with essentially the same look and feel, and this fits the bill. Add the improved display (less bezel), SD card capability, and improved battery, and I'm a happy camper. It took a little getting used to to have the fingerprint sensor on the back, but now it's second hand to go there. There are still things I want to acquaint myself with, but so far, I'm enjoying the phone quite a bit."
3,"I have had the s8 for about a month. I'm not sure,why everyone says these phones have the better photos between it an I phone. But I don't see it. There are no photo modes to speak of. night shots and outdoor shots are not nearly as good as previous versions. But even those were not as good as an i phone taking photos next to me. 

The spell correct and apps that are standard are not nea let as good as my older version. Everything's harder to use. I wish I'd bought the stripped down phone to put on apps I want. Sure wish I could find the old contact app and old phone app. Th ese are terrible. Same with message app."
3,The phone has great features. The camera is awesome. The only problem I have is the durability sucks. I have had my phone for a month & the screen is already cracked. I have a screen protector on it too. I didn't even drop it. It was falling off of my countertop & I caught up against the edge of the counter. So disappointed!!! It cost too much money to be so fragile!
4,"This was my boyfriend's choice of phone for his upgrade from the Samsung galaxy S5. He really likes it. He says it fits really well in his hand. It also came with a free wireless charging pad. The one thing that's weird is the USB C charger which is a different shape than the other chargers we have so I can't borrow it to use with my son's Kindle Fire tablet or my Samsung GS7 phone, but I think he likes it that way."
5,"Great features, excellent camera, ear phones are better than before. Easy you use. It's a must have."
5,I would recommend this phone. It took a little bit to get use to it but it is easier every day.
4,"Great phone, I upgraded from my S5 and was not disappointed. It has a lot of great features. If I had to make one complain it would be that the curved and infinity screen really does not work once you put it in a case like the commuter."
4,Very good addition to the Samsung line.............
5,Best phone I've ever bought. $200 off did not hurt either.
5,I have always been a Samsung user and this product is just a great.
5,"Hey. What can I say. If you like Samsung phones, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The latest and greatest all for the low cost of a laptop! ;-)
I like the memory card slot coming back (my last phone was the S6). Wish the battery was accessible for replacement, that said, my S6 lasted 2+ years and is still going strong."

5,Love the Bixby feature and the ease of use...the camera takes exceptional photos .
5,Very impressed with features of my Galaxy S8. Have not explored all the features at this time but look forward to check them all out. So far I am very pleased with the Galaxy S8
4,"So far so good. The phone seems to be working well, and is holding up all I have put it they so far. Only a month into owning."
3,"The infinity edge is not a great feature. Makes the edge thin and hard to hold. Many feature I had to turn off. Old phone supported ""Private Mode"" for private work related files. New phone has ""Secure Folder"". Old ""Private Mode"" worked perfectly. New ""Secure Folder is a joke."
5,"Have had for month now, no problems works good , camera is awesome, plenty storage, easy to use"
5,"I recently chose to upgrade and after reviewing all options, the S8 was an easy choice. It did not disappoint. The storage capacity allows for dramatically more access to apps and media."
5,great service...very knowledgeable about product ty
5,Love this phone! Easy to use...perfect size and the screen resolution is incredible!
5,"its a good phone, better than my old one (galaxy s6)
Heavy use in my 2 hour commute, and I still hop into bed at the end of the night with 50%+ battery"
4,"I wanted to upgrade my phone, so I went with SamsungS8 and fell in love with it. It has great features and a great camera as always"
4,Fully functional & easy to use & updated & great camera clearness
5,"Takes great pictures, I love the video s. I recommend"
5,The 8S is thinner than my 5S. It is much faster also.
5,"Upgrade from my Motorola droid turbo 2. Phone is user friendly 
Keeps a charge all day"
5,Looks sleek and functions well. I like the beautiful screen on the phone and the colors are nice. Just need to find a screen protector that looks good AND functions well with a curved screen.
5,"love the phone, great screen and function, but the clock on the lock screen is stacked 2x2 and the only way to change that is to download a theme"
5,"With a July 4th sale and an e-mail coupon I paid $200 less than at Verizon and I also got a $100 Best Buy gift card. A Great Deal. Phone was set up at store, and data from my old phone was transferred."
5,"great camera, can be customized very easily, lots of hidden features"
4,"My s5 was getting old and slow, I need a faster phone and the s8 has been working great."
4,I love the fast processing and sleek look of the phone
5,"Very easy to to use, size is great, and really like the security features"
5,"Samsung has it all together. The S8 is an even better upgrade than I anticipated. Easy to use. Great battery longevity. You name it, the S8 has it."
4,"I had note 5 and loved it. It was damaged. And I need phone for work. So I chose galaxy s8 to replace it. I'm satisfied, thus far. The Bixby thing, isn't my cup of tea yet. I love the iris scan. So little effort to open phone and no worries about anyone looking over my shoulder, for password or pattern or whatever. And it's easy to handle, no dropping I hope."
4,New features are great. Self learning . Takes beautiful pictures. Happy I stayed wirh Samsung instead of switching to apple
4,"It is still a great product and easy to use.
It looks good also."
4,"For the price, this is an excellent protector and my phone still fits in the belt case."
5,I've only had my Samsung Galaxy S8 for a couple weeks so I'm still finding out about all the new features. This is the third Samsung Galaxy phone I've had and the camera on this is awesome.By far Samsung's best yet.
5,My wife and I purchased the same case. Many positive comments from friends and family.
5,The Galaxy S8 is an excellent phone. Battery good.
5,I was very reluctant to make this move at first but with the help from the staff at Best Buy in showing me what improvements came with the S8. It has been a very painless switch. I have only been using it for about a week but the photos are amazingly crisp and haven't found any lag yet in any programs I run.
5,Old phone was having issues so it was time for a new one. Like the smaller screen size and it has functioned we'll so far.
5,"Really fast processor, great screen and really like the fingerprint access. Best buy price made it an easy choice"
5,Very surprised that there was this much new technology out thrte
5,I am loving my new phone. The camera and the videos are amazing!
5,I had s5 and only interested in Samsung phone for upgrade. Very pleased with camera . Would purchase again.
5,"I'm happy with the galaxy s8, and am continuing to learn about its features. The service I received at best buy was excellent!"
5,I am thrilled with the phone and what it can do. I would highly recomend purchasing this.
5,Great hassle free upgrade. Phone is functioning very well. No issues so far.
5,"I purchased the Galaxy S8 to replace my aging S5. The S8's battery life is much better than the S5 ever was, and the controls are easily accessible. the fingerprint reader is well positioned, and much more user friendly than on the S5 (which wasn't bad.) The S8 has a much better volume range, and the microphone seems much better than the S5 (on which I had to be very careful about the position of the phone in order to be heard.) An expensive phone, but worth the cost."
5,I love this phone! Was considering switching to iPhone after my Note 4. Glad I didn't. This phone is amazing
4,"The S8 is a beautiful and, for the most part, well designed phone. Screen is absolutely the best and using it to watch videos is amazing. Fingerpri by scanner placement somewhat awkward but workable. This phone was the firstg t o make me move on from an iphone."
5,Always buy Samsung phones. Not disappointed with the s8. Love it!!!
5,"Great phone. The appearance and performance is worth buying. Besides, the front selfie camera is the best I ever seen, by far."
5,"I""ve only had it a week and have been very impressed with it's performance compared to my old S5. Looking forward to learning more about what it can do."
5,"Amazing phone, very responsive, great interface, camera works beautifully"
4,It is a good phone. I like the new charge port no more clamps. I was always bending the charging cable and would have to buy another one.
5,I had S7 and wasn't sure if it was worth it to upgrade to S8. I did and I loved it. The screen is amazing... and the camera is awesome. I love my new S8.
5,I love the new S8! The design is so sleek and thin.
5,"My note 4 died after a system update and I couldn't wait for the Note 8 release. I may not have to....this is a super phone. I intended for it to fill in until the Note 8, but now I may keep it. The 64 gb standard memory is a terrific feature and all the other essentials, screen, speed, etc are excellent.
As usual, Best Buy makes the entire process super simple. Their reps know what they are doing and LOVE to solve any issues that may arise.
Maybe I'll get the Note 8 for my wife....we could trade."
5,"So far I love this phone. The screen is great, the phone is fast. Love the AOD. Pictures are awesome."
5,I like the phone. Only bad thing is the screen protector didn't work very well.
5,"Great phone, GREAT camera. Battery lasts longer than the old galaxy's, very user friendly if you have used a galaxy in the past. Love my new phone."
4,Delicate! Get a case unless you want a cracked screen. Otherwise great phone.
5,"This phone has loads of new features compared to the Galaxy S7, including the new Bixby personal assistant."
4,"Upgraded from a s5 so lots to like about the new phone. Greater storage capacity, 16gb-64gb, better camera. It was smaller than I thought it would be, much slimmer than the chunky s5. Battery life is soooo much better, I catch myself just plugging in out of habit now. What I don't like is... all new cables again....USB type C. Glad I finally took the plunge and upgraded!"
5,The camera on this phone is totally unbelievable. Amazing quality and outstanding design.
4,"Very nice phone. I had an S5 and went to the S8, seemless transition. Highly recommend for current Android users or even those who may be new to the Android OS."
5,I wanted an Android. Having to learn all over again as I am coming from an iPhone. Like it so far.
5,great phone easy to use i likeixby how you can use the b
5,upgraded from early samsung and this phone is wonderful. great camera and ease of use is wonderful. great purchase.
5,going from an Iphone to a samsung took a couple of days to learn differences. seems like a great phone. camera is amazing. great purchase.
5,This phone is amazing. I especially love the camera.
4,Nice phone. Good battery life. Lots of new features. Just wish it came with a book to show more of the features since I'm not a tech person it will take me a lot longer to figure out all of the cool features
5,This is a great phone with great features. Everything is clear
5,"Really like the phone. Upgraded from the S7. The Iris scanner is a little touchy, but is a nice added feature. I know a number of people said they did not like the fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, but I personally like it there better. It also seems to work much better than on the S7."
4,The new Samsung S8 is slim and light. It has above average video - the pictures are very clear. Great camera.
4,My first smartphone. I am still learning how to use it but love it!
5,"Moved from an iPhone 5 and was worried that it would be harder to use then an Apple. Screen display is great; nice size keyboard; excellent picture quality. The one draw back is that everything was enabled when I got the phone. However, the ability to customize was far superior to Apple."
5,You won't be disappointed. Best phone available on the market!
5,"Started having battery/recharging problems with S5. This is a wonderful upgrade, better camera and longer battery life"
5,Just a great phone overall everything you need right in your hands!
5,"I upgraded from the galaxy S5 and couldn't be happier with this S8. Pictures are so clear, and loving the amount of GB it has. I can have so many more apps now."
5,"I purchased this phone for my son , was looking for something slim line with a great camera . After research and talking with my son , we found that it was a perfect match for him. He loves everything about this phone"
5,The Galaxy S8 offers some cool updates from past Galaxy phones. My favorite is the fact that all you have to do is swipe up for the apps.
5,We had the former version of this phone and was upgrading. We were already pretty much settled on selecting this phone. It's newer slender design was the biggest reason.
5,Me and my husband use this cell and like it. Camera is good.
5,This phone is awesome. Great screen. Great functionality. Love that it comes with 64 gigs of storage.
5,"User friendly. Great pictures, clear text and email screens."
5,Awesome resolution and fast phone! Everyone wants me to take the pictures now.
5,I've had the phone for a little over a month and love it. I'm sure I still haven't tapped into the full potential of all of it's capabilities.
5,"I have been and will continue to be a Samsung Phone user. The new S8 is easy to work, great display on the screen. Great purchase!!"
5,Awesome phone! The screen is very nice. Great features and easy to use.
5,Awesome phone! The screen is very nice. Great features and easy to use.
5,Much easier to adapt to than previous cell phones.
5,Fits great in the hand. Durable without a case and no fear to drop or have around water.
5,"I have owned the Galaxy s6, s7, s7 edge and this one (s8). And this iteration is by far my favorite. Great screen, fast processor and very light."
5,"I have easily transitioned from my Galaxy S7 and it has not disappointed. It already has a chip in the corner of the glass from my 2 year old grabbing it and throwing it, but previous phones would have been completely shattered from the toss onto the pavement."
5,I had a Samsung Galaxy 4s for 4 years and loved it before purchasing the Galaxy 8. This phone is a huge improvement over the 4s especially the camera and battery life. I love it!
5,I like the new upgrades from earlier Samsung galaxy phones.
5,Great camera. Very easy to use. Nice amazing camrea.
5,I had an S4 for 3 years and finally upgraded to the Galaxy S8. So glad I Did! Display is great and battery time is awesome! Still learning about features.
4,Good product good quality would definitely recommend
5,New Samsung Galaxy S8 is a lot quicker than previous ones and screen actually feels smoother.
5,Purchased this for my son and he loves all the cool new features.
5,Phone was a little high but it's easy to use it if your in WiFi or something.
5,"Best Smartphone on the market.
Waterproof,expandable memory,amazing screen,great camera,fast/wireless charging, and a headphone jack.
#applesucks"
4,I love is a great cell phone is have great camara and great view
5,Bought this as a gift for a friend's birthday and they loved it!
5,"Slim fit for a good hand fit,too many features for competitors to catch up to"
5,"Finally upgrading from the S3, a few changes and difficulties learning how to get all the features functioning. But it's working great."
5,I was upgrading from a Galaxy Note 5 and wasn't sure if I wanted to. I am glad I did. This phone is blazing fast and has an amazing screen. Love everything about it.
4,I had this phone for 2 weeks and it froze 5x...i have gotten 2 updates in the last week and it seems to have resolved the problem
5,I love my new samsung galaxy s8. Nice size and love the way it works.
5,My husband loves his new phone. Fits great in his pocket and easy to use
5,"A great phone, easy to use. Best buy was fantastic on price. Very helpful on any questions I had."
5,My Son Loves his new phone! Great coverage and so many cool features!
4,I do like my phone but am not sure if I should keep it. I will decide in the next few days. It is very sensitive and picks up every touch and puts you somewhere you didn't plan on going. I will give it a second chance.
5,purchased because of the quality of the camera. It is the best!
5,"I have tried several brands of phones over the years, and Samsung is a pleasure to use. it syncs well with my Samsung tablet"
4,"Pretty awesome phone, but Verizon's coverage is garbage. Calls drop all the time and it takes a while for texts to send. Internet doesn't always work"
5,This is a great phone and easy to use. I had a Samsung and its a little different but I figures it out
5,"Had it for over a week now, huge fan. Can't wait for Bixby assistant."
5,I am very happy with the S8 and new functionality of Android. The screen size is excellent and the thin feel is very ergonomic.
5,"Took a little getting used to, switching for LG. Phone has everything available."
5,The Verizon and Samsung representatives were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
5,"I bought this as an upgrade/replacement for my iPhone because I did not like the newest iPhone which requires wireless earbuds to charge the phone while listening to music. I am extremely impressed with the screen and camera quality of the Samsung, and very happy with the overall phone quality. It is definitely an upgrade."
5,I've been using Samsung phones and this is the very best!
5,"I am not new to the Samsung Galaxy line of smart devices having owed the Galaxy, S3,S4,S5 and now the S8 which may cause me to be biased but if a product is made well with it's consumers in mind then they deserve my loyalty to the fullest extent. The S8 is an amazing phone with all the great abilities of those other smartphones all in one great package. I particularly like the higher quality screen and camera which compliment each other very well. The finger scanner and retinal scanner are next level Star Trek tech that makes me the user feel like I work at Silicone Valley. Truth is it's ease of use and friend Android platform maske it a cut above the rest and if your hesitant from what happened to their Note rest assured that those days are long behind them, get this phone you will not regret it!"
5,"I love this phone and all of it's amazing features. I haven't had a chance to truly explore everything yet but everyday I discover something new. Oh and the amazing camera, sound quality and headphones that come with are fabulous. It has a long battery life and I stream practically all day. So far no negatives about the phone, but the tempered glass screen protectors do not fit with any case I have found so I had to go with regular ones. 
All in all, best phone I've had by far!!"
5,"I am a die hard Apple fan, but I'm loving this phone. Screen is beautiful. Just buy it."
5,"Beautiful phone. Not too big (I wear on my belt), fast and has all the bells and whistles. It has done everything I have asked of it and really appreciate the extra memory (compared to my old iPhone). The touch screen is very responsive and my daughter tells me the sound quality is much better even when using it in the car. I'm very happy with this phone. Best Buy set it up in the store (man was that an easy transition), thanks to their helpful staff."
5,"I finally decided to try the Samsung Galaxy phone and so far I have not been disappointed. I upgraded from the LG G3, which was I thought was a very good phone but the Galaxy S8 blows it out of the water. It's taking a little time to get used to but I'm glad I made the switch!"
5,So much better than my s5. More features and shortcuts imaginable.
5,"Before I had the S6, this one is a good upgrade from it. Top notch quality so far."
5,Are the best phone Samsung has come up with has so many amazing features would not trade for anything
5,"Unlike the S7 that I owned and had inopportune restart issues, this S8 is a dream to use."
5,"I've had this phone for 2 weeks now and loving it more everyday. Great camera, beautiful screen, takes great pictures, fast processor, good battery life, and best of all calls are crisp and clear both my voice and theirs. 

The only cons so far are the usb-c plug replacing the micro-usb. I know it's much faster charging but everything else I have is micro-usb so now I get to invest in more cords. The other con is the battery is sealed and not replaceable. 

This replaces my LG G3 of 2 years and is far superior in every aspect. I would recommend going to Youtube and watching a few tips and tricks videos to jump start all the possibilities."
5,"Nice phone. Easy to hold, talk and text. Pictures are very sharp."
5,Everything is perfect 100% recommend would not change a single thing with the phone.
5,I recently switched back to Android from Iphone the past 2 years. Glad I made the switch back. Phone is easy to use and the camera is amazing!
4,i love the sleek design. Superb Camera. i love the edge part of this phone
5,Went from an iphone and I am amazed at how much I was missing out on!
4,S8 is a great phone with crystal clear camera. !!!
3,"As soon as I took the phone out of the box to charge, the error message ""moisture in charging port"" popped up. Seems like if you have sweaty hands then this might pose an issue. Besides that I wasn't fond of how the edges of the phone resembled the EDGE."
5,This is the best phone I have owned to date. Not sure how much they can pack into the next one. Love buying it from Best Buy as they have great incentives over the carriers.
5,"If your a fan of Samsung Galaxy, this phone will not let you down. This phone has a long battery life, charges quickly. The camera is impressive; it takes high quality pictures. Over all a nice phone."
5,"If your a fan of Samsung Galaxy, this phone will not let you down. This phone has a long battery life, charges quickly. The camera is impressive; it takes high quality pictures. Over all a nice phone."
5,"It has a larger screen, faster than my old iPhone, can take longer drops, waterproof, still has a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and has removable SD card capabilities."
5,64 GB of storage is enough for my wife. Phone boots and runs very fast. A little slippery and breaks easily from experience. Buy a case with it or you'll be sorry.
4,I like the curve screen and the smoothness of the device. Very clear images.
5,"MUCH better battery life is the most noticeable improvement. The S7 edge screen was also super fragile, the S8 is more durable. Love it so far."
4,I like the phone. Only had it a couple of weeks. Overall good quality. I am a little concerned with how hard the home button has to be pushed.
5,This phone is so dang cool. It's all anyone could ever need.
4,This phone works very well and takes great photos. My wife uses it and has zero issues with it. It's no iPhone but it's a close second.
5,Only had for a week...........................................
3,"Pros
Looks good
Fast

Cons
Aspect ratio
screen scratches"
3,"the Phone itself is nice easy to use. When using it as a phone the connection is poor. Poeple on the other end cant hear you well, sound like you are in a tunnel"
5,This is the best phone I've ever had and I got a great deal at Best Buy.
5,This is the best phone I've ever had. We got an awesome deal at BestBuy too. Get it.
5,Great phone. Easy to transfer and set up from old phone. Great camera. I am very happy with Samsung products and will continue with them....
4,"It would get 5 stars but Samsung has removed the remote control features. The edge screen is also hard to get adjusted to. Regardless, it does do what I need."
4,"I love the new Galaxy S8 with its wide curved screen. The Bixby feature would be nice if it actually worked but there are alternatives. You definitely want to buy a case for this phone,"
4,Long time iOS user switched over to take advantage of Google ecosystem. So far seems like a good move. Lots of overlap in functionality between Android and iOS these days. Still getting used to some of the changes.
5,This is a superior cellphone with excellent display.
5,I really like the Samsung Galaxy S8. It has all the features I like and want. I like the curved edges too.
5,we love Samsung phones so we're always a big fan of their devices. we've not had the phone a week yet but so far it's great.
5,Best samsung phone I have had yet! I have been using galaxy phones since the beginning and they just keep getting better!
5,"Great phone. Battery life is great, do wish it had more of a button on the bottom."
5,I had the Galaxy S6 and thought that was a great phone but the S8 surpasses the S6 in various categories. I am very pleased of the S8 so far.
5,"The phone is sleek, great battery life and cool features. I have had almost every Samsung phone made and I am in love with the s8"
5,"I bought this phone and compared to my lg screen at home that's calibrated, this phone has a red tint. Otherwise for those who don't care about color perfection this phone is Amazing"
5,"I've been looking at the S8 for awhile but wanted to read more reviews before making the purchase. So far, I'm happy. Easy to handle. Pictures are clear. Good choice."
5,This so awesome never have to worry about memory from taking pictures on my phone
5,"Big screen, takes nice pictures, easy to use. Thanks"
5,This is the best Galaxy phone ever! Not only is it super fast and super smooth. I have the same amount of apps as I did on my S7 and there is no slow down. The screen is big and beautiful and the switch from the iPhone 7 was super easy as well. I've switched between Apple and Samsung so much because I was always underwhelmed but this phone is amazing. I haven't really used the camera but the couple of pictures I've taken are beautiful. The mix of the S8 and Android N is a mix in heaven. You will not be disappointed by this phone!
5,LOVE this phone.I upgraded from an s5<
5,"Upgrading form an S5. Everything is great here. The fingerprint scanner worries are not really a problem--you don't take pics and use the scanner at the same time!. Great storage capacity, battery is good so far (~2 wks), great camera, etc..."
5,Best Samsung phone so far with back to being waterproof
3,"Decent phone, but time will telll how it holds up."
5,The battery in this is so much better than the S7.
4,Only have it a couple of weeks and like it so far. The one thing I wish I could change is the time on the screen so it would be on one line instead of two.
5,I went from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and there has been a bit of a learning curve but I'm loving it.
5,The features on this phone are amazing. The camera takes the best pics I've ever seen
3,"Due to an inability to keep track of my phone I had to get a new one again. I like the camera on the S8, but not wild about the infinity edges."
4,"I've been a fan of the galaxy since 1, this phone is great but already gotten the black screen of death. Don't know what happened, had to reset twice now, but other than that works great."
4,I upgraded from th s6 edge to the s8+ and have loved it so far. The only downside that I have seen is the Bixby button is a little annoying because it is easy to hit.
5,Love all the features specially the camera and video.
4,"If you've liked Samsung's phones in the past, then the S8 will satisfy you. While it is still preinstalled with Samsung's notorious bloatware, the S8 is another example of Samsung being the best at what they do. While some people may have difficulty getting past the lack of a home button and the new charging port, it is a rather seamless transition."
5,"Granted, I am very loyal to Samsung, but this phone just blew my mind. Between the screen resolution and the camera, I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this phone. The features that you can customize are endless."
5,"Granted, I am very loyal to Samsung, but this phone just blew my mind. Between the screen resolution and the camera, I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this phone. The features that you can customize are endless."
5,"Great phone even better camera. Long battery life, and fast charger"
5,"Excellent sleek phone, and easy to use. Fast Android system"
5,great phone! rather choose this phone over the iphone 7 !
5,"User friendly phone, I always buy Samsung because I like the quality and the apps on this phone, screen is easy to read . battery life is good!! size of phone is perfect"
5,Best phone in the market with no other to compare!
5,Best phone I've had to date. The features and sound are awesome.
5,"I switched from an iPhone and i love the S8. The features are great, i am so happy i made the switch."
5,"I went from an S6 to the S8. Glad I can now have an SD card again. I like the physical features...lightweight, slim and narrow which is easy to carry."
5,"Wonderful phone, many options and a knockout camera."
5,"Wife loves the new phone...slicker and faster
Camera is awesome
She loves the video conversation with grandkids"
5,I love the screen the pics stand out a lot sharper
5,All the reviews are correct. This is a great cell phone.
5,Great phone and great service very good battery life camera and processor
4,New phone has excellent picture quality. It is heavier than older models. Very similar screen to samsung s6 edge.
5,Buy the PHONE it well worth the price and you won't regret it.
5,I love this phone. Our location did not get the best reception with my old phone but I get excellent reception with my Galaxy S8 and the pictures are awesome. Still learning but very pleased so far.
5,"My Samsung Galaxy S8 in Orchid Gray is everything I expected it to be. It's beautiful, intuitive, and easy to use."
5,I've had this phone for a month now and once I got used to the differences from the Galaxy S6 I had I have fallen in love with the phone. It has many improvements that I really enjoy.
5,The new Samsung Galaxy S8 has great feature and is easy to use. The curved screen is a nice feature and makes the phone stand out. The camera takes great pictures.
4,The Galaxy S8 is by far the best model from Samsung to date. Very few glitches unlike previous models and the best design.
5,Love the phone great pics comes out so clear. Love the screen
5,Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Not to many upgrades that takes away from the original line but the upgrades that enhance this phone.
5,"Great so far, big change from the 5, many cool features, VR is great."
5,"Minimum Bezels, ability to switch the back and app drawer keys along with a great camera and screen make this one of the best phones I've ever owned. Put on the Google launcher and you have as close to stock as possible on a beautiful phone!"
4,"I really like the way it fits in my hand. Not too big, not too small."
4,Like my new Galaxy S8. I got it only for few days now. It looks nice. I will update after few weeks of use.
5,This phone was brought for my mom and she loves it. She likes the size and it's easy for her to use. She has questions but most of the time she figures out on her own.
5,"Samsung nailed it with this one! Ease of access, security, and improved water resistance make this their best product to date. You can't go wrong with this phone."
4,"I am liking the new screen shape, but it took a while to get used to. Phone features all work well."
4,So far I am liking my new Samsung Galaxy S8. Takes great pictures.
3,NOT READY TO REVISE ALL FEELING NOT SO GOOD WILL USE
5,"I traded in a Galaxy S6 and purchased this Galaxy S8. The S6 was a very nice phone and worked great, the S8 is in a different league. A fantastic phone !"
5,"Lots of fun new features, upgraded from s6. Sleeker design! Like the waterproof feature, hoping I never need to try it out though."
4,"This phone has an excellent camera and the way they look and how fast the applications move, it's great how it works"
4,"Almost perfect...just get rid of touchwiz (which is much better now though) and Bixby, and it would be perfect."
4,Wife's phone..She very happy..happy wife..happy life
5,"Great screen, fast connections, love the face recognition unlock. Easy to hold in one hand. Charges fast. This phone has it all."
5,I Love my new S8 phone! I am still learning all of the things that it does for me. Great camera and very easy to use.
4,First new phone on 4 yrs..alot of new features..3 weeks and still learning to use somethings
4,it's just okay not as user friendly as my iPhones.
5,Very happy with the latest updates to the Samsung s8
4,"Generally works well but sometimes when I'm talking on phone I will get a vibration and lose my call. Will stop in and talk to Samsung agent about this. Also, tired of all the ads to purchase extra stuff which I find annoying."
5,"There aren't enough characters available to rave about this phone! While I don't know what Bixby does, there are so many other new features to keep me busy. The Edge screen is way more robust. The translation by camera helped me figure out if I could throw the box away or not. The video is amazing!!!!! Still has the voice command features for selfies and pics, and they added Instagram-like filters....with animation! Highly entertaining!"
4,Love the ability to surf and talk. Main reason I got the new phone. It's an upgrade from S6.
5,"Love the size, awesome side view, easy to use, fun phone."
4,"IF this had both an IR Blaster and a removable battery, this would be the greatest phone ever made. The bewildering location of the finger print scanner being immediately adjacent to the rear camera lense also leaves more to be desired. Otherwise, this a marvelous feat of cutting edge technology. Ridiculously gorgeous. PERFECT build, quality, and incredible performance. In a word: amazing."
5,"Another great Samsung phone. Better battery, screen, faster processing, and just all around a great phone."
5,"Great so far, no problems at all. Very similar functionality to the s5 it replaced"
5,"I am enjoying my new Samsung 8 phone. It is similar to the Samsung 7, thus it is not hard to learn how it works. I have been able to figure out some kinks."
5,"A few things that I didn't read anything about in the reviews that i found personally useful after 1 week. You can designated ""trusted sites"" so your phone doesn't always lock if your in those spots. I hated having to unlock my iPhone every time I was driving (which is very often) and the fingerprint reader was fickle. The S8 knows when I'm in my car and home and my office so it doesn't require me to unlock it in those places. That's a nice feature.

The Message+ app (I'm not sure it's actually a Samsung app but might be actually from Verizon) has some additional tricks in it over the stock iPhone text app. I never used some other apps if there was a stock Apple one, so I'm not sure that's available on both phones anyway.

The level of customization is almost silly, but if you want to really personalize almost every aspect then you can. 

The one down side is that the texting features in Apple are still better with the ability to add the emoticons/emoji's and I miss being able to draw things like the iPhone 6 and up can do.

The smoothness of the whole phone makes dropping it a concern. I don't really like cases- what's the point of the developers spending money on the physical phone if it's covered up? But, I also don't want to drop the thing because it's summer and my had gets sweaty from holding it in the sun...

Overall, I'm adjusting to being in an Apple free phone world, and it's working just fine with the promise of working great."
4,"Good solid phone, very similar to previous Samsung phones. Getting used to the Edge component, and I don't completely like it but I don't completely hate it either. Aspect ratio of the screen is odd, with the ultra long height and condensed width - not the greatest for viewing video. The phone is very slippery - I dropped it twice within a few days, so I would recommend purchasing a case that offers some traction."
5,I'm still learning all the things it can do. I had an S4 so this is a big upgrade fro me.
4,Best Buy associate was a sloppy entering data to switch to S8. He put wrong # from my account so no calls for a week until I knew about incorrect account #
5,My wife has the S8. I have the S8+. Screen size isn't obviously bigger but my wife's smaller hands likes the S8. Mine prefer the S8+.
5,Nice new features. I find myself using just one hand more so than on my previous Samsung phones.
5,"Switching from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5, to the Galaxy S8, I was a bit hesitant. I did not want to lose my stylus, nor did I want to lose the smoothness of my Note. After doing tons of research, I decided to give the S8 a try. I will say, it did not let me down! The S8 is everything the reviews say and more. The only downfall is missing my stylus, but with all the other features it has, it makes up for it 100%! Being water resistant, and bringing back the SD slot was also a plus. I have tons of space, the front-facing camera takes better pictures than any phone I've had previously, the navigation bar is amazing, and the battery life has been extended. I will say, the phone can get hot when you are using is none stop, while it's plugged in. But it did not mess with the functioning of the phone at all. I highly recommend this phone, and am blown away by it."
5,The screen is so nice and crisp. I like a lot of the other additions that they have added.
5,"Samsung has definitely made improvements to the Galaxy line of phones. If you are looking to upgrade, this is the phone you need!"
5,"So far...so great! I havent had it long but love it, so far. Great camera!"
3,"Got this phone for my husband, it's not as sturdy as described. Not happy with it at all."
5,"I'm very pleased, coming off 8 months with a Moto G4+ which lost its Bluetooth 3 months in. This phone is everything you expect in a Samsung galaxy phone. Reliable, beautiful, plenty of storage (64 gigs), feels great in a small hand like mine."
5,"I am a galaxy person this is my 3rd phone. I had the s3, s6, and now the s8. So far it's been a great phone."
5,This is a great phone. A lot of features that my old phone did not have.
4,The phone is nice. Beautiful screen. I mainly upgraded for the camera which I absolutely love
5,"Love trading phones at Best Buy. They are the best, so patient to answer all the questions."
5,So far so good. It's always a hassle to get used to a new phone.
5,"Love the phone and it makes great pictures. Easy to use,"
5,Great new phone. First smartphone for the Mrs. She likes it and is moving forward with new Apps.
4,"Nice phone, but the speaker is weak and the screen cracked from having it in my pocket without a case in about 2 weeks. The durability of phones should match their price. The replacement of the button with a touch sensor"
5,"This is the best phone I ever had, I would recommend this phone to everyone"
5,"Slim, trendy design and fast. The happiest I've been with a Galaxy since the S4"
5,Absolutely love it. Great team at store. Best phone I ever had
4,"learning about it slowly. like how it charges , and the pictures it takes"
5,Great phone. Much faster than the s5. Getting use to the curved screen.
5,This is my first Samsung. I am not sure why Best Buy has not pushed this on me before. Hopefully this phone makes it passed a year unlike every other smart phone I have had.
5,Easy to use nice open interface and Android software to boot.
5,Awesome device! Has an amazing camera with cool features built in. Easy to use with one hand. Not heavy or clunky.
5,"I am loving this phone, I have been able to use it all day and i don't worry about it dying on me."
5,"I got the Galaxy S8 to pair with VR goggles and 360 camera. For the goggles at least, it does not disappoint. I still have to try it with the 360 camera before I can provide a review."
5,THE COLOR AND FUNCTIONS O THE PHONE ARE GREAT. THE CAMERA IS AMAZING
5,GREAT PICTURES SO FAR I LIKE THE PHONE. REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE CLARITY OF THE PICTURES IT TAKES
5,After having this for just 3 weeks I am still finding more things that this phone can do. My other family members have the S7 and I phones but we all think that this has a better camera and screen resolution. I am getting a full day of use in rural area with 25-40% battery remaining at the end of the day. It is a bit bigger than I was used to but very slim. Even with an Otter Box Commuter case this fits well in my pocket. Not heavy either.
5,"Love this phone! Screen is amazing. Battery life is so much better than expected. Very fast. If you like Android, this is a great phone for you. Only inconvenience is the fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the phone, but I have gotten used to it, so it is no longer a problem for me. Overall great phone for the 1 month I've had it."
5,My friend upgraded her phone to the S8 on my account. It was a tremendous upgrade from her old phone. It's fast and it has a great camera! Not to mention it looks good! I like this phone and I'm an iPhone plus user too!
5,"Love the purchase, very easy. Outstanding product."
5,Great battery life. Great camera. Takes great pictures.
5,"the battery lasts much longer. That battery dropped like a rock. Good phone so far, like it a lot. Upgraded early and am not sorry."
4,Just starting to get familiar with it. I like the size and the look of the screen. Did not like the Verizon text ap.
5,"Although I am still learning all this phone has to offer, I am in love with the phone! Easy to use, great screen, and amazing camera features!"
5,"I assumed this phone would suck the life out of a battery, however, the phone has no flaws."
4,"But in Orchid Grey and added OtterBox Symmetry Clear/Silver cover and get a lot of comments on how nice the phone looks. Cover works well too, I know granddaughters are tough on phones."
4,Moving up from a Galaxy S4 what's not to like about a new S8 phone. The camera is amazing. Apps load fast and work well. The battery life is really good - two days on a charge. My only complaint is the protective curved glass i bought with the phone. It has really made the touch screen desensitized. Have to push hard on some of the shortcuts and then it wants to remove them.
5,I've only had the phone about a week but the battery life is great. The camera is awesome. I really like the blue light filter so late night browsing on my phone won't mess up my sleep cycle too much.
5,The infinity screen is a great addition to the Galaxy phone series
5,"sharp screen. easy to use, battery life is good,good over all size"
4,"Purchased this phone on Memorial day, really easy process. Had to return to store a couple days later though. WiFi wouldn't connect to any network, had a hardware issue. Swapped phone and haven't had an issue since."
4,"I love my S8 it is a great phone, but I miss my button from the S6."
5,"The curved edges of the phone arent very sensitive and require more care when the fingers are there. Go a tad slower and press a tad harder. Other than that, it's a boss phone."
5,"This is a great phone, Samsung has outdone themselves with this one. My 1 complaint is that I can't find a glass protective screen that works well on it. The edges of the phones screen are curved and with a glass protective screen on it the contact with the phones screen is poor . When trying to text, characters on the screen do not respond unless you use a lot of pressure on them."
5,"I was looking at the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 as my first smartphone. However, I looked at the S8 model and really liked it. Initially I thought it was coming out at the end of the year so I dismissed it, but when I heard it was coming out a couple of weeks later, I decided this was my phone. I'm still getting used to all the features but I've been very happy."
5,Samsung never disappoints. Love everything about the phone
5,"Bought this as an upgrade for my husband from the Galaxy S5 and it is a great phone but you have to be willing to learn how to use all the features it has, which are many! It has a great camera. Not a phone for beginners. My sons and I love the phone and we are all iPhone owners!"
5,Best android phone on the market... the free wireless charger and 100 gift card sealed the deal...
5,"Great phone, great design. Navigating the phone is effortless because the software is similar to my last Galaxy. No complaints so far. I loved mine so much I bought this one for my girlfriend."
5,Samsung has done it again. Great phone. Only negative is regarding the edge sometimes is difficult to select items such as texts with letters on the edge
5,Audio through headphones could be better. Headphones somewhat disappointing.
5,I'VE HAD MANY A SAMSUNG PHONE. THIS IS THE BEST YET. I BIT OF A STEEP LEARNING CURVE BUT WELL WORTH IT. AMAZING SCREEN. FAST RESPONSE. SOME REALLY COOL FEATURES.
5,Love the quality of pictures. Easy to use when we upgraded from the galaxy 6.
5,"No Really. I have had several smart phones over the years but this one is different. Picture quality, battery life, ease of use . . . Amazing. I love it!"
4,Love my new phone. It is great and now has Bixby on it.
5,I bought this phone for my daughter and she really loves it. She said it is easy to use and loves the larger screen.
5,"Love the phone, customer service answered all questions that I had and even transferred my information from my old phone to my new one."
5,"This is a great phone! It is one of the best phones I have had. The battery is the best part, very long lasting"
5,Great new phone. The camera is excellent and easy to use. Battery life is much better than previous gen
5,"I love my Samsung S8 smart phone. It has so many features that I am still learning. As an Android phone, it cannot be beat."
5,Phone lives up up to expectations. Went from a note 5 to this. I'm happy.
5,I love samsung galaxy phones and this one lives up to my expectations! Love this camera so much more than the S5 had.
5,Got my phone from best buy.salesman was very knowledgeable on phone.Samsung has a rep at best buy who is also very knowledge.They set my phone up and took time to showe me how to work it.It takes great pictures and is easy to operate.Still learning bout all the great thing it can do.people can hear me clearly and I can hear them
4,I have been a fan of Galaxy S phones since the GS3. I haven't even started to use this phone to the full potential. So far I haven't had any problems.
5,"Amazing phone, tons of customization available. Great size with a beautiful screen."
4,"So far this phone seems great. Easy to use, tons of space."
5,"The processing speed is great, the screen is amazing and the camera is the best I have had on a phone."
5,Feature packed with a great size and weight. Like th he new c connector.
5,"Very nice phone I recommend this to users of Samsung phones 
The camera is excellent the voice quality is excellent and the features are numerous 
Video quality is very good 
Battery lasts longer on this phone than prior versions and has a battery saving feature which I really like ."
5,Good phone as always. Is all the phone I need and never gives me issues.
5,My 4th straight Galaxy...cant go wrong! Still prefer Androids over those other guys!
5,Rolls in the greatest parts of S& and S& edge into a great new device. Also has the newest android OS on it
5,I am a samsung fan and this phone has not let me down. This is my favorite one yet. Features are great and camera is awesome!
5,"A great upgrade from the Galaxy S7. Didn't think I'd like the edge screen, but after using it for a short time, I don't know why I didn't choose the S7 edge in the past. Definitely 2 Thumbs Up!!!"
5,If you are looking for a cell phone this is the one. The display is excellent and the shape of the phone fits great in your hand.
4,I was able to navigate with the on screen tutorial.
5,"Bought this for my wife because she had a iphone and didn't understand how to use it. Android phones are so much better than apple, they are intuitive where apple you need to learn how to use it."
5,Great battery life and nice clear vibrant screen. It's everything I wanted!
5,Upgraded phone from Galaxy S6 to S8+ and received a $200 gift card which was great. No issues so far with the phone.
4,I've only had to charge this phone every other day. Nice features
5,This phone is the perfect size. Wonderful screen and takes beautiful pictures.
5,"From the box, the phone made sure I didn't miss a beat getting back ""in business"". Samsungian 4 Life"
4,"Nice camera, long battery life. Resemble the Samsung 5 in quality"
5,"This phone is rated as the top smart phone and I can see why. My last phone was a Samsung S5, so this one is a big upgrade. It holds a charge for two days, the camera takes excellent pictures (this is coming from a long time Canon user), and so easy to use. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new phone."
4,This is really a great phone with really nice features!!
4,This is a really nice phone with lots of great features!!
2,Had phone for 2 hours and led screen went out. Returned the phone and didn't get another. :( not happy.
4,"This phone has a great camera and video quality. I've only had it a week, but it is a huge upgrade over the S5 i had previously with many great new features."
5,"Great phone with unlimited possibilities. Ive not even scratched the surface. Great features, fast and great size."
5,"I liked this phone so much (See my previous review), that I bought my wife the same model. But with a different cover."
4,Screen shattered with just a small bump on the first day. Overall I think it is a great phone with excellent technology but I have never shattered a screen and barely bumped this on a corner and it shattered.
5,love it! It Does everything I want and more! Even adjust the size of font so I don't have to wear my glasses to read it
5,It took 2 days to get everything working as before with my Galaxy S5. Even with Samsung easy connect. But it was well worth the effort.
5,We are very happy with this phone. Bought it for our daughter and she has been delighted with it. Just be sure to buy an Otterbox Defender case to protect it!
5,The perfect upgrade for my wife. She loves the phone with all the new features
5,I have been buying Samsung phones for the last 4+ years and they have never disappointed.
5,I was so upset then my previous phone finally died on me. I hate getting new phones. but boy am I glad now. I absolutely LOVE this phone.
5,My wife loves this phone. Best Android phone in the market
5,Great new phone. Now even my broken apps work now.
5,i love the phone and im glad i brought the phone ...
5,My wife needed a new cell phone since she has been using a smart phone from 2011. Now she can do all the latest stuff on it and she is very happy so I'm happy!!
5,"Everything about this phone is great the camera, options, speed, color, picture. Im glad i got this phone"
5,"The edge to edge screen on this phone is awesome, It really sets the bar to another level for Phone visuals"
4,"I had a note 3 which was bigger so I'm struggling with the small one. It's definitely harder to figure out. The camera is terrific and I'm sure I'll
like it when I get used to it."
4,"This is a bit difficult to get used to after the Note 4 because the size is smaller but it is easier to put in a pocket! One issue is the home button right below the space bar when typing, often hit the home button instead of space bar. Kind of miss the physical home button. There are some very nice updates."
4,I really like the Samsung line of phones and this prove to be a very good upgrade from my Samsung 6. The only feature I really question is the finger print being on the back. It seems to be a little trickier to use then when it was on the front of the phone. One of the main things I like about the Samsung is the Samsung Pay that can be used at just about any store. The IPhone & other androids are limited at this time. The only place it has not worked is at the gas pumps.
5,The phone is wonderful! Everything that I love about Samsung and more! Best phone on the market
5,The best buy representive transferred all of my files. Then gave instructions how to operate the phone. I did have a question later in the day and the representative gave a helping hand
5,I like the Galaxy S8. Best Samsung phone ever. Great Screen...
5,Everything new takes getting use to. I don't think the screen is quite as sensitive as my old LG but the battery life is phenomenal and the software has been rock solid so far. I wish they hadn't changed the charging cord to USB-C as it is different than every other device out there.
5,"Great phone. Videos look amazing. I think it runs a lot like my other galaxy phones, but the camera is better and videos are better."
5,Bought to replace an S5 that lasted forever. Couldn't be happier with this new phone. Beautiful design and great features.
5,"It's basically just another android phone like all the others. It does everything my old Galaxy S6 did. However, I can use it in my Gear VR without it overheating every 10 minutes. Also, the battery lasts MUCH longer. I don't noticed that it's faster than the S6, but it can certainly handle more load if you use any intensive apps at all."
5,"This phone is definitely the most powerful, feature-rich mobile device that Samsung has released. It is extremely fast and responsive and the screen is amazing. I really appreciate the various performance modes available depending on what I'm doing, as well as multiple, customizable power save modes. I'm also very impressed with battery life in general on this device. Great phone!"
5,"Samsung is simply the best! My wife has had her S8+ for a while so I got the S8 for myself. Very good, very smart too."
5,I have always had Samsung phones. They never disappoint.
5,"Easy to use, great camera and graphics. Thank you for all your help best buy costumer service"
4,When considering this phone vs the plus go with the plus especially if you have large hands. Also if you are buying it for the edge feature don't waste your money. Not good for reading txt as the words wrap all the way to the edge
5,I thoroughly enjoy this phone. I also bought one for my wife!!
5,Love my new phone. Great battery life. Great pictures
5,The Samsung 8works great and has an excellent camera
5,"Have been only iPhone since the 3GS, and this has been such an awesome upgrade. Android is very stable and app store has everything I could want."
5,I love this phone. Battery lasts forever and it looks great. Never overheats and I actually really love the USB C since it's the same whichever direction you turn it.
4,So far the S8 has lived up to my expectations! Ihave had the S8 for about 2 weeks now and like it. I have had the S3 and S5 and have a Note Pro 12.2 tablet. I really like samsung electronics.
5,This is a fantastic phone. It has an amazing camera with many of the features of a digital SLR. The screen is nice and large. I love my Galaxy phones!!
5,"Samsung has out done themselves with the galaxy s8. 
Pros 
Screen resolution 
Camera 
Security 
Battery life
Con
They did change the charger to a type c but they do give you an adapter so you don't have to throw away your old charger

Overall hands down the best phone out"
5,"Very high tech! At least for me. I will need a class offered by Samsung to get a few things clarified,but overall, I am pleased with my purchase and its performance and would recommend it to anyone who wants to make an upgrade."
5,phone is absolutley great much faster than my htc m one 8
5,"I love my new phone. Great pictures, storage, download speed, etc."
5,Early mother's day gift for my wife. She loves it. Takes incredible pictures and videos.
5,"Love it. Best Samsung galaxy yet. Camera great, easy to use. Love it!"
5,This is the best phone ever. Love the pictures and the overall feel on the phone. It is very fast.
4,"I have been a fan of the Galaxy series for a while and the S8 continues that trend. Easy to use, fast, and well designed. I do regret not going with the larger Plus version just a little as the regular S8 is a bit more narrow and that has taken a little getting used to, but overall it is still a great phone."
4,Perfect size. Great camera. Nice color. Wish the had more notification options.
5,The Samsung galaxy s8 is an amazing phone. The possibilities are endless and I am just now after 2 weeks finding more ways to use it.
5,"This is the best Galaxy phone that has been released to date!! Even though the finger scanner is now on the back it is still easy to use. 

The infinity display makes it stand out even more over previous models. It is also more efficient and ideal for storage using the built in or SD memory."
5,So many features and great camera! And bixby is super cool.
4,Only had for a few days but been great so far. Nice screen
5,Very happy camper. Good purchase! Camera quality has steadily improved with each updated model.
5,The only thing I don't like about my Samsung 8 is the quick menu that gets in the viewing path of other things I'm trying to do.
5,"Everything about this phone is top notch. Very fast and responsive, the camera is the best low light phone camera I have used."
4,"Pretty awesome phone. The edge is a bit annoying. I keep touching it and things happen even though I disabled it. The case helps. 

The one really big issue I have is the 10minute limit to record UHD video. QHD has no limit but I want as high def as possible to record a 2 hour performance. Not possible. 

The gearvr is AMAZING!! Get one if you can. 

The lack of a real button for home takes some getting use to. I miss feeling a click.

The size of the phone makes one handed texting harder even with the shrink ability. 

If I knew someone with monster size giant hands I would definitely recommend. 

Otherwise sure I would recommend."
5,"this phone is incredible, it is lightning fast, dependable, with a great screen. The new operating system is fantastic, with all kinds of new shortcuts and time savers. The bio metrics are excellent. Overall, the best phone I have ever owned."
5,Phone works great and has the best screen out there.
5,Has a great camera and easy to use. Like the fingerprint option.
5,"Of course this is a great phone. This is a top of the line phone from a top of the line company. The advertised edge to edge screen seemed like a gimmick, until I started using it. This new style of screen gives the phone a great look and an even better physical feel."
5,Every time I use the camera I think I'm a pro photographer
5,I upgra ded from a Note 4. New phone is very functional. All the standard features and a lot of new ones I am still learning. Battery life seems to be excellent.
5,This phone was everything I wanted and I'm happy to purchase it at best buy. I'm extremely satisfied.
5,Best phone I've ever owned. And I've owned about 14 of them over the years. I don't know where to even begin. It's just excellent! Won't be disappointed at all. It'll be the best purchase you make.
3,Good phone not great! Samsung enthusias. Bixby is junk and talk to text feature has a serious lag if it even works at all! Look at all the android choice out there before purchasing. Would not recommend for the price.
4,"Very good phone so far, would have given 5 stars but the Bixby app, and samsung pay kind of annoy me"
5,"Only have had it a few days, but loving how smooth it is. How great the pics are it takes, how easy it is. And fast w/lots of memory."
4,Great phone with easy set up. Never had a Samsung before but the transition was a breeze with a great phone.
4,"A strong smart phone that looks as good as it feels. Some of the commands are not as familiar as they should be and I have yet to find a use for bixby, but the camera is amazing and the phone feels good in your hand."
5,Upgraded from an S6 that gave out on me. Love everything about my new S8
5,So much better than my s5. Has an amazing battery and so much more storage.
5,My husband and I both upgraded and we are very pleased with them. The camera is fantastic and the rounded edge screen is really awesome!
5,Best smartphone ever! Does everything well. Really like it!
5,The best phone I've ever had. I highly recommend!!
5,"a lot of similarity between the 6 and 8. The curved screen takes a little to get used to, but I'm enjoying it."
5,"The Samsung G8 is great so far, my old phone was the G4 so this is a big upgrade."
5,Love the photos this camera takes. They are incredible!!
5,Best Samsung phone I have owned. Battery life amazing.
5,Self setup was a breeze. Screen is amazing. would definitely recommend this phone
5,I haven't had a new phone in 5 years so i love this new Samsung.
3,Camera is not the whole screen like the 6 and 7. They were too busy adding apps to my you look like animals. When I went back to best buy to talk to the Samsung rep to ask about the camera he said that there s no way to fix it. Very disappointed
3,Don't like that updates aren't immediate like pixel
3,I bought this Galaxy s8 used it for less than a week the camera is still the exact same as the S7 battery is the same so it's not worth it took it back already got a mate 9
5,I purchased for my spouse for father's day. He has never owned a smart phone. Has been very easy to learn. He loves it
5,Love my new Galaxy S8 and the color too... Battery lasts a lot longer than the older model!
5,Love my new Galaxy S8 and the color too... Battery lasts a lot longer than the older model!
5,Best Samsung phone so far. This phone is awesome best thus far.
5,Great quality phone. I really like it. Good camera and sound quality
5,Great quality phone. I really like it. Good camera and sound quality
4,This phone would be perfect if it had vanilla Android on it. The hardware is a master piece.
5,"I am thoroughly enjoying my new Galaxy S8. Still acclimating to all the great features.
I previously had a Sony phone with a 22mp camera. The camera on my S8 blows the Sony away, even though it is not as hi definition. It was difficult to get fast pics with the Sony. The S8 gives sharply focused pics even when snapping them quick-draw. :)"
5,I upgraded from s6 (never had a 7) so it was a worthwhile choice. Much better battery life and faster response time. The camera quality seems better as has been said in the reviews. I like the new wrap-around screen (edge to edge). Definitely happy with it.
5,"I like Samsung Galaxy phones. This one takes great pictures and has a very sharp crisp quality, which is great for videos and games. I also really like the infinity edge on it. The sound quality with headphones is also excellent. The charging plug has changed shape, so of course, none of my old charges will fit in it. But the phone itself os awesome."
5,"Absolutely love the phone, it's very fast, has a GREAT battery life, and has a GREAT camera even in very low light. A MUST HAVE!"
4,"The phone seems to change screen options (security, home, always on) on a whim and doesn't always save my choices."
4,My only real complaint is that the screen is a bit too touchy (sensitive). Another annoyance is the steps through various menus to make simple adjustments.
5,"I switched from an iPhone. I previously had the s6 though. The s8 has a much better camera front and back. Front camera no longer looks like overly saturated GTA characters lol. Battery life is eh but a lot more sage than the Note 7. If you are switching, it's worth it. If you're upgrading it's worth it. Unless you have the s7. Just wait"
5,Easy to use. Was considering going back to an IPhone. Glad I stayed with the android.
5,Love this phone. Great sound & picture. Easy to use.
5,I really like this phone. It is totally what I expected for. Great camera. Its really clear like dsl professional cameras. Samsung never failed me.
5,I really like this phone. It is totally what I expected for. Great camera. Its really clear like dsl professional cameras. Samsung never failed me.
5,Got this phone for my wife. She loves it awesome camera also. Verizon made or really easy to transfer all the information over to the new phone even though she killed the old samsung S7. Pick this one up you'll love it
5,"The only reason I got the Galaxy S8 was because my beloved Note 5 screen cracked. Seeing that the S8 was recently released, I took a chance and went for it, it wasn't love at first sight but it eventually grew on me and now I love my S8!"
4,"Coming from a samsung note 5, it was an easy adjustment. Love the phone so far. 
Pros: Battery lasts forever. Camera is great. Front facing flash. Lightweight & thin. 
Cons: The extra side button for Bixby (phone assistant). I'm always accidentally hitting it. I haven't found a way to disable it yet. Not a fan of the 'edge panels'. I'm always accidentally swiping it (but i can see where it could be useful for someone who wants quick access to favorite callers and other apps). 

Overall, i love the phone...just trying to get used to some of the added buttons."
5,"Great phone, I have the S8+ & this S8. The plus could be clumsy but this S8 fits just right. The orchard grey is a great looking addition"
4,What more can I say. Love the phone. love the edge.
4,This new phone has bee a bit of a learning curve. Large screen with crystal clear pictures
5,"Top of the pile build quality, more durable than it looks. Preinstalled software is sometimes imperfect, but it's Android so you can remove and replace."
5,"This is a great looking phone and fits great in my hand. I thought I would really miss the physical home button, but Samsung has done a great job of integrating it into the screen. I'm not a fan of the fingerprint scanner being on the back of the phone as it makes it impossible to unlock my phone with my fingerprint while it's sitting on my desk or table. Overall, a fast, great phone."
5,Tim Hutchens sold us on these phones and we are so glad he did.
5,"Nice upgrade from an old S-5. Easy to use, like how the charger is easier to use with the non-specific direction on the plug."
5,Upgraded from my droid turbo 2 which was not connecting to our wi fi. The galaxy s8 seems to be able to do it all in addition to being very attractive. The screen is vibrant and the display is unbelievable! Takes great pics and seems very responsive. This is my first Samsung and although I've only had it a couple weeks as of now I love it.
5,Best buy was the best price ....great customer service!!!!
4,"Really enjoying this phone so far, although I'm sure I haven't even truly explored 1/2 it's best features yet. Easy to hold. Nice customization. Beautiful camera/pics. Only complaint is I DO noticeably see the battery usage decrease quite quickly, so I wind up charging every other day about."
4,No issues with mine so far. Solid phone overall and only little bit of getting used to needed
5,I love my S8. The features are awesome especially the camera. The best One yet.
5,I have had no issues with this phone! Great camera and great features. I upgraded from my Galaxy s5 and couldn't be happier.
5,"Superior camera, long lasting battery charge, large memory, and Bixby has some unique features."
5,The phone is easy to use and not as heavy as the G-6 so far I like everything about this phone so far .
5,Was exactly what I expected it to be. Meets my needs
5,Paid off my old phone and moved up to the S8. No regrets whatsoever.
5,"She is not so tech oriented, but she dove right in and likes it."
4,"My Galaxy S6 broke so I was forced to get a new phone. The Galaxy S8 has a great camera and a great battery life. I've only had it for a week and a half, but I am happy so far."
5,"Great screen color and camera, and amazing battery life. The curved screen takes some getting used to but I do like it. My one complaint is the fingerprint reader--located on the back of the phone it is not as accessible as the front fingerprint reader"
5,I love this phone so far. The screen and camera are great and it fits perfectly in my hand. Light weight and is easy to use.
5,"The s8 is my first Samsung phone and I'm really happy with it so far. My previous phone was the LG G3, which I'd had for around 2.5 years. It was the best one I'd ever had and certainly lasted the longest even after being dropped pretty much on a daily basis. I had planned on getting the G6 originally but it wasn't available at my local store​ so I got the s8 and I'm glad I did. It's great looking and isn't uncomfortable in the hand, the camera takes some pretty amazing pics, no lag or other issues with speed or capability, and the battery lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. The only thing I'm not that fond of is the fingerprint scanner location but that's not a big deal. I do miss being able to tap the screen to turn it on like I could on my G3 and the remote control app on the G3 was pretty handy too. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the s8 and definitely recommend it."
5,"This phone is amazing! Vibrant color, easy to use, and Best Buy helps with transfer of all data!!"
5,I upgraded from a S7 Edge. That was a great phone and this one is even better. Very impressed!
4,The Samsung S8 phone is very nice. It is easy to use and a big improvement over the S7.
4,"Old phone stopped charging this charges much better. Very customizable, can uninstall bloatware!!"
5,"Battery, screen, camera, size, water resistance, wireless charging, and good headphones all round out to make an incredible phone. I like it!"
5,"Extremely satisfied with the Samsung S8 and the staff at my local Best buy , My new phone is great easy to use and outstanding graphics and camera, I use it for maps while on my bike its exceptional!"
5,"New to smart phones.Still have lots to learn.Best Buy was really helpful while purchasing and explaining. Took photos of events recently. Love all the options,very easy to use.Battery last about a day."
5,Love this phone. Easy to use and understand. I would highly recommend it.
5,5 stars on the phone. I love the phone. Samsung galaxy S8 is amazing with all the apps and software upgrades.
5,This is the best phome you can choose out of any right now mid 2017. The specs beat anything out.
5,Top line specs. Fast service. Unbelievable. Best phone on any carrier you could get.
5,"Love the size. Fits perfect in your hand, and the sound quality is excellent. Nice camera, and good water resistance. So far, it is all I had hoped for."
5,Very nice phone with great display and functions. Easy to use. I love the camera of the phone.
5,I totally love it. A little bigger that than the S6 but I still love it.
2,"The phone sucks the life out of battery, I don't even use it and the battery will decrease by 4 points, Unless I have every thing off and the power save mode on max save. I don't like the keyboard, I mistype on every other word."
5,Love this phone it has great picture quality. Battery life is awesome.
5,"I don't usually drop my phone, but this case with the rubber around it will be nice. The whole thing still fits in my back pocket."
4,It looks really great until you get it smudges. The color is great.
4,I love my new Galaxy S8 It's easy to use and navigate.
5,She was a diehard iPhone user and she loves the S8.
5,Loving my new phone. Plenty of memory. Beautiful display. Takes great pictures. Fast processor. No heat issues.
4,Love the Samsung phones. Don't think the camera is all it is cracked up to be.
5,"As of today, it’s the only phone that checks ALL of my needs: Excellent rear camera, excellent front camera, water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro SD card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the S8, Bluetooth 5.0. The Infinity Display Screen makes watching videos awesome. The camera takes excellent quality pictures."
5,"easy to use 
awesome pictures
nice looking screen."
5,"Another great Samsung phone. Great feel and look. Reception is on par with all Samsung phones...great. Screen has fantastic resolution, sharp colors, clear. Best camera yet.... Love this phone and it's quality features."
5,"I upgraded from a Note 4. I love, love, love this phone!"
5,This is actually my husbands phone and he thinks it's great.
4,"After breaking my S7edge I decided to purchase the S8. It's very similar. I do not like any of the ring tones. The notification light is too tiny and can hardly be seen. It's difficult to set music for ringtones. I can no longer add photos to most things as easy as before. And I was told the battery life was the same at time of purchase on both S8 AND S8+ but they are not. And screen shots are awkward to take. 
I miss the button for waking phone up it's now touch. 
All in all a great phone ...research and look for deals before purchase."
5,I upgraded from an S6 to the S8. The transition was easy. I LOVE the phone for a camera. I recently took my phone and camera (Sony) out hiking - and the pictures taken by my phone were better!
5,"No cell phone is worth $700+, but if you have to spend that much to get a phone, this is the one to get. Nothing wrong with it at all."
5,My last android was an S6. The edge takes a bit of getting used to. The finger print scanner is much more accurate too. Having no buttons is nice.
5,Great upgrade on from Samsung Galaxy s6 with the additional micro sd
5,bought this for mothers day for my wife and she absolutely loves it. tons of features and very good for work.
5,Love everything about the device! Takes awesome action shots
5,"Great camera, alarm tells you what time it is before it starts great for when you have more than 1 alarm set, can reply to text and stay on the same screen. Love ir"
5,"The Galaxy 8, so far, has been an awesome phone. My only recommendation to others is get a case immediately. The screen is easily cracked with a short fall."
5,Great display..awesome battery performance. Best Buy made the transition from my old phone to my new S8 completely painless.
5,Love my new Samsung Galaxy S8. It has a absolute beautiful screen and incredible features. Nothing comes close to it.
4,"I had an s6, and the s8 has far better battery life. I can get through a day without charging. The camera is also good in lower light and for action shots. The phone sometimes freezes though, which is the 4 instead of 5 rating."
5,"My boyfriend loves this phone and now I'm planning on switching from my iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S8 as soon as possible. I've had iPhones since they first came out, but the s8 blows the iPhone 7 out of the water."
5,Had an iPhone but all samsung tv's and had always loved them. Phone works well with my needs. Easy to find apps and the camera is great.
5,Bought this phone as a gift for my sister and she loves it
5,Picture's are great and phone fairly easy to use. Need more instruction
5,I have no complaints with the phone. It's slim and sleek. It's also very fast. The camera is amazing.
5,Well I have been using the iOS system for a long time but since this phone was released and I needed a slightly larger display I decided to give it a try. Android OS has come a long way since it started. This phone (and its functions) is easy to use and don't forget how AWESOME the camera quality is. I am definitely a believer that this particular Android system (I'm sure it kind of varies from each phone brand) surpasses my iPhone 6! Glad I made the switch :)
5,A total upgrade from my last devices. Wouldn't trade it for anything else
5,"Sharp screen, easy to use. Have been complimented on the phone."
4,Had to take back my original purchase because it was internally bad but new one is good so far.
2,Liked the S pen on my note 5 much more and it had a bigger screen.
5,Saw this promotion and we jumped on it..Bestbuy staff was great. Very happy with Galaxy S8.
5,"This is my second galaxy phone, having upgraded from the galaxy S4 which I had for over three years. As you can imagine, this phone is a significant upgrade. The 64gb memory is great and it is extremely fast! I am very worried about scratching or chipping the glass, so a good case is a must!"
4,"I like it specially because of the expanding of the memory, but I am really not happy with Samsung's customer service."
3,Just another typical overhyped Samsung product loaded full of bloatware and junk to slow the device down making it a paperweight
5,"Battery with wireless charging is very easy, new size fits nice in hand, great phone!"
5,This phone is great! I especially like the wireless charging
5,This phone is great! It's not as large and bulky as my previous one.
5,"Not the biggest fan of the curved edges but with this phone i dont care, very good phone very stable. best phone out right now"
4,Sales associate should have spent more time explaining the various features of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 . He had to ask another associate several questions in completing the order.
5,"I liked my wife's Galaxy S8, so I went ahead and purchased one for myself. I cannot complain. Phone works well. Great pictures, battery life, speed, and the plus with the external memory."
5,"We have continued to purchase the Samsung Galaxy series of phones and have yet to make a complaint. Phone works flawlessly so far. Speed, resolution and the external memory card were all a plus."
5,Replacing Note 5. This one has same size screen in a smaller package. Great features and battery life for me. Great purchase.
4,"I CAN'T SAY WEATHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD IN DIFFERENCE FROM THE SAMSUNG S7 BUT NO PHYSICAL HOME KEYS ETC... IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY TO GET THE HANG OF BUT ONCE YOU HAVE TIME TO EXPLORE IT, THE DEVICE BECOMES PRETTY USER FRIENDLY....!? :)"
4,"I had a 6, and when I switched over I was expecting to be wowed.. the screen is larger, but Swype does not work as well and there are a more annoying features that i have to work around. Like a really fast (10 second) lock screen. I still prefer the galaxy over the iPhone any day."
5,"This phone is perfect in every way. Just like my wife, except that I can trade the phone in after a year if I don't like it"
5,Love android phones and this seemed to be the best ... Proved to be true
5,Never had a smart phone until now. Still learning how to use but so far love it. Mainly got because of the camera. To take better pictures of grandkids.
5,"phone looks great, works great. I'm very HAPPY with my purchase"
5,Really like my new phone.... takes great pictures... compact.
5,So much better than my old phone. The camera is awesome.
5,"Big improvement in battery live. Great camera. Easy setup at Best Buy.
My wife loves this phone."
5,This is an upgrade from the s4!!! Sure is fast in every area.
5,I love my S8! I upgraded from the note 4 so first I noticed how much faster it is and the camera is pretty incredible. Overall very pleased with my S8.
5,"I am of the ""elder generation. Changed from S4 to S8 and am absolutely thrilled with the ease of this transition. I was very apprehensive to change fearing I have to learn something else new with these gadgets but to my surprise it caused me no anxiety. The S8 is easier to use and I love it. Only wish I would have changed earlier. Now in 18 months I'm going to update and I can't wait. Have no fear seniors it's easy!"
5,"I think this beats all the other smart phones I ever had. Works great, size is great and screen is very clear. The camera works great too."
5,"Easy to use, love the camera and pictures. The size is perfect."
5,"I upgraded to the Samsung 8. Only had it a short time, but no complaints. And...Best Buy staff and Samsung Rep at store were very helpful and knowledgeable."
5,"This is truly a great phone. I loved all the new upgrades, like finger scanner and spilt screen, etc."
4,"I like 
the big screen and the colors. The sound is really clear when you get a phone call."
5,Love the new S8! I am a Samsung person that is all I have ever had so I love the new updates!
5,Great Phone! Speed is great and the clarity is 2nd to none. Love ability to customize the sound of my music to fit my needs.
5,Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great compact and powerful phone!
4,Haven't upgraded for 3 years and so much has changed. I'm still adjusting to how the features work and how to get the actions I'm familiar with.
5,Perfect size like the edge to edge screen. Still learning all features but so far love.
4,The screen is awesome. Phone feels great. Runs super fast.
5,"I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S5, so this phone is like heaven."
5,"The screen is amazing-and i thought the S7 was good. Phone seems to be faster also. Case is slippery though-if you're at all clumsy, invest in some sort of protection that extends out enough to protect the screen in the event of a direct fall."
5,So much better than my old S3. Battery lasts so much longer and chargers so much faster. Still many features I have yet to explore.
5,Best phone I've ever had. Great screen and easy to see.
5,LOVE the phone and all the new features added from the last version.
5,"great phone, great promo with the free wireless chargee, best buy added gift cars was a nice benefit"
3,"I have had problems with-it randomly restarting, doesn't like to save my photos, and the Internet connection for A4G go slow"
5,"This is hands-down the best android phone on the market. Smooth, fast operations. Great camera."
5,"I recently purchased this phone as a replacement for my ancient iPhone 5s and I couldn't be happier! I've always loved Samsung products and the S8 is no exception. The camera is great, the screen is great and, best of all, it's tough. My job is hard on phones and I've already accidentally drop tested it and tested the water resistance, haha. I've had this phone for a week and my one and only complaint is the location of the fingerprint reader. My small hands make it difficult to access with one hand and I have to use the pin to unlock it when it's laying on a flat surface. Otherwise, it's a wonderful phone and I'd definitely recommend it!"
4,Very nice phone with lots of great features. The cordless charging is a bonus . Easy to use and great camera.
5,Over all-good design except the Bixby button. It is always in the way and being pressed. That is very obnoxious.
5,Definitely better than all the other phones out there.
5,This phone is absolutely beautiful. It feels like I'm holding the future in my hand.
5,This is the best phone out on the market. It is the perfect size and can do everything that you need and more. I love the camera because the pictures and videos are done with such high quality. The S8 has a lot of room for all of the apps that you want to download.
5,I'm not good with technology at all & I had no problem learning all the different options.
5,Love my new phone. Great product features are amazing
5,Love it phone is amazing great camera great display
5,"Had an S4 for years until I broke it. This was a nice improvement, nice camera and the learning curve was very small."
5,I have had my phone for about 3 weeks and have to say I'm so glad I upgraded from the S5 very happy!
4,Phone is great. My son loves it. Has a good camera.
5,This phone is the best Galaxy yet and I've had more than several.
5,So happy I decided to get this phone. My best upgrade yet!
4,"This is a phone that takes some getting use to, but it is really a good phone"
4,Easy to use and wonderful battery life and pictures are amazing
5,"So far, so good. Not a techie and never got a top shelf phone before. This does way more than I need. The interface.. blah blah and the firmware.. beep bloop, combined with the giga-whatzits memory space stuff... Seriously though, makes phone calls, takes great pics, does stuff on the internets and you can get different apps that do stuff.. Heck, I'm on it right now reviewing it. Gotta be some kinda space and time shattering paradox. Go git ya one. It's pretty cool."
5,"Have not had a new phone in 4 years, am really enjoying this one !"
5,"So far my experience with the Galaxy S8 has been as expected. Perfect screen, great response, great sound, great camera. Hoping that everything continues to go smoothly. The only thing that I don't like about it is the Bixby button."
4,"Our old Samsung S5s were on the way out--time to buy new ones, in this case the S8. Seems much the same as the S5, but bigger. Nicer camera. The rounded edges are tricky, however--my wife's S8 is stiffer when trying to touch or tap things near the edge. Mine is better in that regard area. It may be the Zagg glass screen protector. Battery life is excellent. Also, it is hard to access the settings function and other icons that appear at the top--I think that is the Zagg, too. All things equal, it is a good phone."
5,"The phone is slick, and has an easy grip even for the plus. Amazing purchase!!!! 
If you are in the market for a new phone the search is over."
5,"I love the phone and all it can do! Very happy, very satisfied."
4,"The first phone kept dropping internet connections, but after calling Verizon twice they said it was probably the hardware. Took it back to BB within the exchange period and they swapped it out. New one is working good."
3,Nice and slim but slippery. Broke in the first week.
5,We got 3 of these for my wife and my teenage kids. Everybody loves this phone.
5,"This is an absolute breath of fresh air. Not that I am against Apple, I just thought that the Samsung deserved a competitive chance before 2 consecutive upgrades in the Apple world. Learning curve is SIGNIFICANTLY more intense than the I-Phone. But, it is NOT rocket science."
3,"When asking for phone to respond to verbal questions, Google or Bixby responds with a very fast speed occasionally. When I took it back they said that maybe the SIM card was bad but I just got the phone within the last two weeks. They replaced it and it happened again. Also, my Samsung 6 got better reception than this one"
5,"I LOVE the new Samsung Orchid Grey Phone Cover. It matches the color of the phone (important to me for some reason!) and the cover allows the phone's clock to display through. Best yet, there's a kickstand, so you can use the phone hands-free, if needed/desired."
5,I love the infinity screen and high quality camera of the new Samsung Galaxy S 8. The long lasting battery and the enhanced speed convinced me to stick with Samsung when I upgraded my cell phone..
5,"Wife loves it! It is sleek, powerful and finally utilizing the whole screen."
5,"This phone is simply amazing! Looks great, feels great, very fast."
5,"Not much to say, other then this phone is amazing! From its slick look down to its fast performance."
5,"Camera has good quality, Phone is the same as S7 just with more features."
5,It's a great phone to get into. I had the 5 before and this was a nice upgrade. I like some of the new features.
5,My wife needed an upgrade and it's been a great phone. A few quirks like everything but so far really works well
5,"Great phone, trying to figure it out since I am tech challenged."
5,I will probably will never learn all that this phone has to offer. So much that it can do.
5,"Probably the top phone out there. I was close to getting the LG G6, but I said heck with it and paid the higher price. Better screen was top issue for me. I don't need speed, but I still went with the S8. Nice size and easy to handle for me."
5,"I went from S3 to S5 and now S8. I'm very pleased. This phone does so much and does it well. Will be learning from now on all of its great features. We have a wedding soon, so will get a chance to see what the camera does. The volume on this phone is loud. The screen is awesome. And the phone just feels good in my hand. I did want the 8+, just couldnt justify the higher cost. Now my S5 seems like an antique. I hope to get a fit gear soon to compliment my purchase"
5,"Samsung has created an awesome new phone with the S8. Too many features to comment on here. The one drawback is the main button. To wake the phone up is now part of the touchscreen. Even changing the sensitivity, it doesn't always respond at the first touch."
5,This phone is awesome. It's everything I expected and much more.
5,"awesome phone don't like where they put the finger print scanner at, right next to the camera."
5,"Great phone, very fast and high tech. No complaints. Samsung did well on this phone. Phone doesn't get as hot as my note 5 and responds quicker and the battery lasts much longer. The new operating system has many improvements over older versions. Very happy. Best buy has the best deal when getting this phone too."
5,"Fast, user-friendly cell phone. Totally impressed with the photos."
4,Gave less than '5' because voice dictation doesn't seem to function. Support says something wrong w/Samsung keyboard but now has stopped working w/Google keyboard (which is inferior to the Samsung).
5,I researched and decided to hold off getting the S7 and wait for the S8. So glad I waited. AWESOME PHONE!!!
5,"Has all the bells and whistles. Great camera. Easy to use and waterproof, which is good since it spends a lot of time near the pool."
4,I love this phone. Amazing camera super fast processing speeds
4,"I upgraded from am old windows phone and had forgotten how much I like android. This phone is really powerful. I wish that I could remove more of the bloatware that comes on it, however many can be removed. The camera is decent, the dimensions fit my hand just fine. I'm glad I got this one over the larger one. Screening videos is pretty awesome as the resolution is great. The one thing that I really dislike is the Bixby button on the side. I am constantly hitting it on accident when I unlock my phone. Other than that, I'm very satisfied with it."
5,"I am a new ""smart phone"" user . To my surprise, I am maximizing it and finding myself more comfortable using it for all needs"
5,"This phone is top notch. Fast, clean looking. Great phone"
5,My friend loves this phone. Color is what he wanted too.
5,Love my new phone. Fits in my hand and it is still large!
5,Taking me time to get familiar with the new phone. Works great in the country.
5,As expected this Samsung phone has what we wanted. We were replacing an older model Samsung and like all the new features of this phone.
5,Upgrading from my S5 to the S8 showed me the speed and quality I have been missing. the phone works great and I have had no issues in the first 3 weeks.
5,Great phone. Went from an S5 to this one. What a great upgrade. It is fast and looks and feels great.
5,"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. It is easy to use, and has lots of space for pictures of my grandchildren."
5,Many great new features. Favorite is the face of phone stays on showing time and date. And at night the glow won't wake you.
5,"Great display, fingerprint reader a bit inconvenient, Bixby not working yet, but overall a great phone."
5,"I love my new phone so far. Still getting used to some of the changes but I gotta say I happy with my purchase. Camera is much better, also holds a charge much longer. Great phone."
5,"Good first phone, easy to handle, good camera and size"
5,"Good camera and first phone, easy to handle. Nice size"
5,"I've had every Galaxy Phone since the S3, and so it's no surpise I got the S8 as well. Love it. The edge isn't as curved as the s7e which is great; it really reminds me of the Note 7. No lag, great phone."
5,I liked it and very nice to use. Lot of features available compare to other phone. Excellent camera.
5,"Only been using it for 2 weeks thus far so, I am not aware of all of its capabilities. Very quick. Retina recognition software is amazing. Had friends try to open it with their eyes and were not able. Coming from a non-android type phone, the S8 ""quirks"" take some getting used to. So far, am a believer."
5,"Smooth, fast, highly customizable, gorgeous display and pictures. No disappointments even for the money"
5,Great cell looks great and performs as good as expected for a new samsung device
5,"I had the Samsung 7 before I upgraded, absolutely love this S8. I had a problem in the first week and best buy took care of it that day."
5,This phone is so light weight and easy to use. It has the slim feature but ease of finding things and the actual apps are easy on the eyes
5,"Love this phone I like the curves
Like the size and thinness of the phone"
5,I love Samsung. The phone is easy to use and great for multi tasking. It's perfect flipping from app to program with ease.
5,"I am a devoted Samsung fan, and I love this phone. My S7's screen was overly sensitive and it drove me crazy. This phone is perfect for me."
5,Samsung as done it again. Great front facing camera for selfie.
5,Absolutely fantastic. Super sleek and has great battery life.
5,"Just got the only about a week now, but so far I love. It takes nice pictures in the dark."
5,I upgraded from a S5 and what a difference. So far I love it. Easy to use and a lot of memory!
4,"Love the galaxy phones, stared with a 3 and now with 8"
5,I haven't learned all my S8 can do yet but I do Love it!!!
4,"Missed my sdmicro card slot (had galaxy 6, before that galaxy 4, 3 etc... purchased an iPhone for husband and it's okay for his needs (and hes a total newby to smart phones lol ;) but I ♡ lots of options!"
5,This phone does everything and more that I need it to. Easy to use great pics
5,Always loved my Samsung phone and each one gets better.
5,"I bought this right before traveling to Europe for a 2 week vacation, the Camera takes wonderful pictures work both the forward and rear facing camera. The curved screen allows for excellent ease of viewing documents and other items ."
5,"We went from the s3 to the new s8. Our old phones were eating battery life faster than Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Daytona. The new s8 battery seems to go forever. The phone is fast, sleek and fun to use. The camera has many new options that i have not even tried out yet. Great phone that should last for a few years to come."
5,Absolutely love this phone. Best phone I have ever owned.
5,Great upgrade for me. Many exciting new features. Easy learning curve.
5,Am enjoying my purchase. It has a great phone and responds quickly.
5,Infinity screen. Beautiful! Easy to use. Only wish was that the pop up keyboard had bigger keys because my eyes aren't good and I make a lot of typos. Best Camera of any phone. Love the feel. It's thinner so it fits in my pocket even with the case on it. Love the size!
5,"camera was for my daughter. The size fits her a lot better. Phone is amazing. Works well, gets a clear signal in the middle of nowhere, and takes great pictures."
4,"This is my third Android smartphone, I have never owned an iPhone, but I've used them often. The Galaxy S8 is a great phone for watching videos, taking pictures, browsing the internet/Facebook, but I've had an increasingly difficult time playing some games on it due to buttons on the edges of the screen being very hard to press. I have pretty average to small fingers, but it's still challenging, sometimes requiring me to reposition my finger dozens of times. That is my only complaint, I really wish they had an S8 that wasn't an edge, because I play games and it is awful for them."
5,"After owning the S3, S5, and Note5 I can say this is by far the best phone Samsung has ever produced. It's fast, has a beautiful screen, tons of features. I do suggest a case if you drop your phone a lot."
5,"This is one of the finest smartphones out there. The phone is fast, clear and slim size that fits into a pocket easily. Great technical featured like enhanced security specs. Camera takes clear crisp pictures. Easy used Samsung software. Mostly it comes in nice looking metallic colors."
4,Major improvement in every direction from my s6. Battery life makes a huge difference
4,I had been looking into replacing my iPhone for some time now as it was due for an upgrade through Verizon. I dropped my iPhone and broke the screen and it became useless as it would have cost more to replace the screen for a fossil 5c. I went to Best Buy to look at the S8 and S8+ and was just as amazed as I was the first time I saw it. When I got the phone home it was super easy to sync with my old iPhone and everything transferred with ease. The features associated with this phone are wonderful and I am glad I made the purchase.
4,"Perfect fit!
This case fits great and protects the phone."
5,"Has a long screen, charges fast, keeps its charge, not fond of curved screen but I like the phone"
5,Electronic gadgets are my adult toys. My new Samsung S8 is the newest of my gadgetry and it has lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend it.
5,"Really nice phone, no problems or hiccups. Iris scanner works just as well looking down at your phone as it does looking straight at your phone as long as your eyes are the correct distance away. Fingerprint scanner takes about a day to adjust to then it's just second nature like any unlock method if that's your preference."
5,"This is a great phone, easy to use, nice camera and really great voice recognition. Blows the Iphone out of the water and is a nice upgrade to older samsung phones."
4,Would be 5 stars if I wasent so worried about the screen breaking. So far works great.
5,"Nice upgrade from my S6, will definitely continue to purchase Galaxy phones. Had a screen issue within one week, but the phone was replaced and I've had nothing but a good experience since. Wish the edges were more compatible with a glass protector but I've adapted to using just a Skinomi and it looks great."
4,I like my phone it's really nice I wish I could've gotten one in the bigger size but it's a really nice phone it's really slim yeah overall it's a really good phone
5,Great phone with an even better camera. Switched from iphone and won't go back
5,"Was skeptical of the curved screen at first, but after using it now I've come to like how it looks. Camera is great. Battery life good."
5,First time I've ever bought a phone that was the top of its kind. Splurged when we changed carriers and I'm very glad I did! Love having enough space for the apps that I want. Also like the buttons and their placement. A really nice phone!
5,"I love this phone, great camera quality, easy to use, fast in speed and secure locking system."
4,"I like the galaxy phones better than iPhones and this one is better than m old galaxy 5, plus it has a bigger screen which is awesome."
5,This is my third Galaxy S phone (S3 & S5 before this). Exceptional battery life and superior viewing angles.
5,This is my third Galaxy S phone (S3 & S5 before this). Exceptional battery life and superior viewing angles.
5,"After putting off getting a new phone for a very, very long time...I refused to give up the keyboard I had on my other phone...I finally had no choice as the battery was not holding a charge. My son recommended this phone and I absolutely love it. It didn't take much time at all to make the switch and I can do so much more with this phone than I could on the other. Much, much faster as well."
4,"This is my third Galaxy (previously an S3 and S5) and this is another great phone! The battery lasts more than a day with regular use, and the finger print ID works slick on the back, even if you do end up smudging the camera quite often."
4,Nice phone and great camera. Only annoyance is sometimes the home button doesn't respond sometimes. Battery life is great
5,"The design is beautiful, the midnight black all around just enhances the beauty and sleek ness of this phone. Great hardware and camera. Very comfortable to hold."
5,I Love the color of my new phone I love the slim design
4,I'm enjoying learning all the options this device offers.
5,This is my third galaxy phone and I really enjoy the features!
5,"I've had Samsung phones for the past several years and always been happy but the Galaxy S8 exceeds all my expectations by far!! Great battery life, awesome camera, crystal clear screen, fantastic internal storage and more!!"
5,Best phone ever. Long battery life. I would recommend getting this phone.
5,I like the phone operations. Quick and can reach buttons with narrower width.
5,This is my very first new phone that is a current model. I am so pleased with it. I would recommend it to just about anyone.
4,"Getting used to the edge screen and how sensitive the screen is when typing. Only have had a week, no problems."
5,This phone is awesome. The software is the best it's ever been. The experience is smooth. I've not ran into any issues. I love that it is water and dust proof. I would buy a case. The all glass body will not hold up well against concrete.
3,Phone performs as expected from other reviews. Phone is slippery and requires a case. Nearly all cases in the store obscure the specialty color of the case.
5,"Larger, very clear screen. Fast updating and retrieval of data."
5,"Love this phone! It's definitely been ""unboxed."" The camera is great. Still getting used to Bixby though. I havent completely gotten the hang of everything this phone offers yet but I am excited to keep playing with it and find out."
5,"Have had the phone now for a couple of weeks! This is a great Samsung phone, sleek, clear screen, and easy to use!"
5,"Great new upgrade over previous models. Better all around, especially battery life."
5,"With this new phone, I'm able to get through the entire day without a recharge. Nice improvement."
5,"I had all the Samsung phones. This one is absolutely the best! Camera is amazing, quality of the pictures are awesome!"
4,"Great upgrades on this compared to the S7, which I also have. Every new phone just gets better and better and just doesn't stop. I wish they would come out with a different backing for the phone since the glass seems a little to breakable, you have to cover most of it up just to protect it from breaking so easily."
5,Listen to me: Samsung has outdone themselves with the GS8!!! The screen is the best I've seen on a cellular device. I give it 5 stars on ease of use! The front camera is very much improved! Great sound from the onboard speaker! I would definitely recommend THIS phone to any Android OR iOS user!
5,"This purchase was for my husband and he LOVES it. He told me he wanted to be buried with it. He has really enjoyed it's ease of use, new features our old galaxies didn't have and he loves the camera."
5,Love the orchid grey color and the phones sleek look. it does everything my old galaxy did and then some. Beautiful pics!
5,"Great phone - very responsive to touch, quick to charge, and a wonderful screen."
5,Love it! Lots of new features for me since it upgraded from the samsung 3
5,"I purchased this phone on April 22nd, right after it was available and love, love, love it! If you've had the galaxy before, this is a must have! It's the best one yet and well worth the price!"
5,"My mom needed an upgrade for her phone but didn't want anything that wasn't going to be durable and hold up. We read reviews and spoke to people. And after a whole 20 minutes going over the product in person she decided to buy and has loved it ever since!
Highly recommend the phone to someone."
4,"Mine broke when it slipped out of my shirt pocket, fell total of two feet, onto its edge and shattered. Works, but essentially useless. I had no insurance, warranty doesn't cover breakage, and I now have a second one, for full retail. Works great, but I now have a protector, which I've never had before, and a full insurance plan for two years. Call me stupid, I love the phone and it works great, still rather have this than Apple, but I swear that, for all its rounded beauty, the S8 is more fragile than prior phones with metal or plastic edging. Just so you know....."
4,Upgraded from galaxy s5 and this phone is a huge improvement. I love the galaxy but this phone does everything I need and more!
5,"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my S8!!! I waited for 2 years for it to come out before I upgraded from my S6. Love the orchid grey color but wish it had a little more purple to it."
5,"For almost the past two years, I have been using an LG V10, also purchased from BB. It's a great phone, but just too big! My wife had been using my old Galaxy S4, which caused me to miss Samsung's clean, functional and intuitive design. I am SO happy with this phone! It works as it should, and everything is where you think it should be. The size is just right - big, gorgeous screen, without being a mammoth phablet. It has some incredible features as well, some unique to Samsung. I wish the back was more ""grippy"", as it has slid out of my pocket unknown to me. The case that came free with the phone will hopefully take care of that. It also is annoying at times in landscape view - you have to be careful not to activate something on screen by touching the top/bottom edges. Both these problems can be easily overcome, however. I also considered the LG G6 when choosing a new phone. I haven't had a Galaxy since my S4, and I am very happy to be back!"
5,So far so good. It was as good as advertised. Battery doesn't show any issues with overheating during charge or over usage.
4,"My old Samsung Nexus finally died on me after five years of service so it was time for a new one. I researched the best phones online, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 was the clear winner according to every major review I read. It probably does way more that I really need, but I wanted to have the best phone available since I use my phone for work and may need some of the technical features later down the line. 

The only reason that I am not giving the phone a five star rating is because of the high price tag. It is more than most laptop computers! It is high tech, but I still feel it is a bit pricey for phone no matter how you spin it."
5,This is samsungs best phone untill the release of the note 8.
4,"The s8 is my first smart phone and it has been very easy to use. The photos are quite clear and precise. My son like mine so much he decided to get the other model available, the s8+"
5,Samsung Galaxy S8 is an excellent telephone for replaceing my tired Galaxy S3.
5,"Large screen, great display, wonderful camera and pictures, and fast. My previous phone was an iPhone and I'm much happier with navigation and personalization on my S8."
5,"This new S8 is my Wife's. Incredibly fast, sleek, powerful, and tons of new features. Clarity of images or video is awesome. Love the finger print relocated to the back. By the camera. Lots of security features. Eye, face, and finger print biometric scanning tools. Too many features to list. Love the curved edge to edge screen. So clear. 64 gb upgraded from the 32gb. Easy to hold. Sleek and thin profile. You'll love this Phone!"
5,I was ready for an upgrade and the new S8 is an excellent option
5,Omg where to begin....i love it! I had the s5 edge and that was ok but the s8 has so many more features. Love everything about it
5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a durable phone that is greatly improved from the S7. Battery life also improved,much better camera."
5,I Phone was fine but offered very little memory for the money....made the switch to android...feature packed with tons of memory plus expandable!!
5,"I do not have a single complaint about the S8, If i had a critique it would be less bloatware but other than that it is a fantastic phone. The screen is amazing. I still cannot get over how black the blacks are on the screen it just blends into the phone. The battery life is great."
5,The storm was very helpful when it came to pick up my phone
5,"I was looking to replace a phone from a different manufacturer and as I was getting ready to pull the trigger on an S7, I jokingly asked when the S8 was due out. After a bit of hemming and hawing, I was told that it was scheduled for the spring of 2017. (I think the salesperson was worried about missing a sale.) No date had been set for release but I'm glad I waited. This device works great with both cars, Chromecast, as well as a smart TV. The VR has also been fun thus far. The Edge side menu is a great feature for favorite apps, weather, most used contacts and several other options that I have chosen to skip for now. My favorite feature is the fingerprint security. I hated having to mess with passwords and PINs just to access my own phone, especially at home. I like that nobody else can gain access, and at the same time, I don't feel like I have to ask for permission to check email or texts. I also use my device as a second backup for all of my Music, Photos and personal files. The extra storage is wonderful! I haven't even mentioned that the screen is beyond fantastic and the basic screens have a smooth look to them. Oh, I might add that if you ever need it, it's a phone too!"
5,Previous phone was S6 Edge. Much larger screen with only slightly larger phone is very useful. Battery is frequently good for two days while S6 was never better than one solid day's use. Return of expandable memory and water resistance are very valuable upgrades.
4,Voice to text is horrible and predictive text literally makes up words but the rest is pretty impressive so far.
5,"I jumped from the Samsung Galaxy S4 to this S8. I'm still learning some of the features of the phone, and I'm still customizing things like the home screen, getting used the the ""Edge"" feature which really reduces the clutter on the home screen. I absolutely love the camera. It works great in low light. I recently took a picture of a table setting with a candle, and the candle light didn't confuse the autofocus, which happens on most cameras, even on my Nikon D80. I can do close up shots with the background out of focus as if it is a wide aperture SLR."
5,I am VERY pleased with my Galaxy S8 phone. I had a Galaxy S4 and was hesitant to upgrade. I'm very happy i did ! it's resolution and ease of use without all the extra apps i'd never have used is very welcoming. it holds a charge and the sleek design with the infinity screen is perfect.
5,its a great phone.. hard to get used to the curved edges
5,I've used Samsung phones for quite a while now. This new Galaxy S8 is by far the smoothest and fastest phone ever. It works great and does anything and everything I need it to do fast and efficiently. I can't recommend this phone enough.
5,Not wanting to renew my contract each time a new phone comes out I used a Galaxy S5 for the previous 3 years. This is a helluva upgrade over the S5. Only drawback is the curved screen is hard to click on at the edges. Great picture and sound.
4,"New S8 seems to be dropping calls. I've had Verizon for 20+ years and although this could be a carrier problem, it seems strange that this is happening now. Otherwise performing well."
5,Have had many Samsung Galaxy phones. Still like them. The S8 has the usual great features of Samsung Galaxy. I did switch from the S8 Plus to the S8 because I didn't like the larger size so much for trying to get it out of my pocket. Still learning the new features.
5,Love it...nuff said................................
5,This phone is great. I was coming from a google pixel which I also like but this phone just fits so amazing in your hand and has way better features. Only down side is the finger print scanner placement but you honestly get used to it and it's nothing
5,I love that the phone was able to be picked up from best buy
4,I upgrade my phone every two years. This one was a little harder to get used to. The curved edge is a little troublesome. I finally installed the Gboard keyboard because I was having trouble typing. I kept accidentally swiping in the edge screen.
5,This phone is a solid product. Its battery life is vastly improved over the earlier S3. The water & dust exclusion rating gives a sense of security. It charges very quickly. The inclusion of a microSD slot increases its flexibility. The two downsides are that the battery is not user replaceable and that both Samsung and Verizon load so much bloatware onto the phone.
5,"I'm a Galaxy lover. Purchased this phone the weekend it was released. I love it so far. The only this that doesn't make sense to me yet is Bixby. Why would they release the phone when Bixby isn't fully developed for another 6 months? At this point Bixby is useless to me, but otherwise love the phone."
4,Jury is still out but so far I like it. Bought it fast when previous phone died. Fits nicely in hand for one hand operation. Good camera. Still lots of features to learn about.
5,I have had 4 cell phones in the past 6 years and by far this is the best one. User friendly with a 5 star rating.
5,Screen quality and side are perfect. Great resolution. Easy to use
5,I traded my Samsung Galaxy S5 up to the S8. I love the camera! I also love that I didn't lose the water resistant feature of the S5.....i am enjoying my new phone
5,Switched from Motorola to S8. Been reading Consumer Reports reviews for over 2 years touting Samsung as #1. Working just as advertised in my first two weeks.
5,I have had 0 issues with this phone yet. Not even any scratches on the screen. It charges mega fast and keeps the charge a long time. Very impressed. Also the camera is hella tight.
5,Great phone I used to have an iphone and after trying out this phone Im never going back
5,Upgraded from S4 mini. Width is similar which fits my hand. Length is okay - I like smaller phones. Love the camera! Finding my way not as hard as I thought it might be moving from the mini in easy mode. Would have like to get a quick guide in the box rather than having to download a manual.
4,"Using the phone a little over 30 days now. Haven't had any issues. Battery life is good, calls sound great, can't find anything wrong with it other than that there's stuff on there (pulse, retina scanner, fingerprint scanner) that I'll never use. They could probably fit in a larger battery or something useful if they got rid of that useless stuff."
5,Upgraded from the S5. Love the versatility. Excellent camera!
5,"Upgraded from an S4 and am so impressed with the speed and of course the battery lasting more than a day. Getting used to the new apps and love them. Have a 5 gig plan for the same price as the old 2 gig plan so can use the phone now than before, plus it's so much easier and more responsive."
5,"Very happy with the S8. Faster, longer battery life, better finger print recognition, and better screen."
5,"Very happy with the S8. Faster, longer battery life, better finger print recognition, and better screen."
5,Samsung has created a very unique(for now anyways)phone. Rest assured if purchasing this phone that you'll have the best that's out right now. You won't regret it. Makes every other phone looks really old and square. I can't picture myself having a non curve phone. Bezel less phones are the next big push and the s8 just set the bar. Followers will soon jump.
5,My wife loves her new phone. We would purchase again.
5,This is a really nice phone. It has so many features and I haven't discovered all of them yet. Very fast and great resolution. I replaced a Galaxy S6 (lost it) and am so glad I chose this one over a S7. Fits well in my small hands and I like the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. No trouble reaching it.
5,"Love it. Picture is awesome. Works great with Samsung Gear VR and I watch youtube, Kodi, Netflix and Amazon prime through it. Its awesome. Battery is also great. Love wireless charging feature as well"
5,Great buy and great awesome fast phone. It could convince me enough to switch from IOS and Iphone.
5,"Amazing product, great pics and videos, awesome phone"
5,"Love Love it! Fits nice in my hand, light and easy to use. The camera is fantastic. Loads of storage I really needed."
5,The amazing thing about this phone is the incredible battery life. I'm getting over a day!
5,This phone is great! Lots of useful features. Very fast and responsive. Camera takes excellent photos. Display is bright and vibrant. Battery is a little better than average.The only down side is Bixby isn't fully fictional yet.
5,Upgraded from galaxy 6. Took some getting use to. Happy for sd port. Great camera. Overall nice phone. Keep your iPhone....ill stick with Samsung
5,Huge improvement for me going from the s6 to the s8. Love it in every way.
5,Still hate the bixby button. But overall love the improvement going from a s6 to a s8
5,"Great camera, great screen, good battery life (getting 5.5 hours screen on time, haven't tried any powersaving modes yet), and performance is great. I have seen no lag like the Samsungs of old. Really enjoy the size and feel in the hand. My favorite thing about it is that the screen looks exactly the same outside as it does inside. No more straining to see my screen in direct sunlight. The only thing I wish was different about this phone is that the Bixby button should be remappable because other than the camera search feature Bixby is a completely useless clone of Google Now. I wont count Bixby as a negative though because its an extra and doesn't take anything away from an otherwise great phone. Lastly the fingerprint location is blown way out of proportion by tech reviewers. I use mine daily with either hand no problem."
5,Love the phone which has a great camera looks great and works like a phone should.
4,"Very nice phone..better than iphone
 Which I returned for this phone."
4,Being an OK computer person I found the camera easy use
4,"I love the phone. Very disappointed that there aren't readily available protective glass covers that get great reviews. Within 2 weeks of getting my phone and researching screen protectors, I decided to wait. And my worse fear was realized. Phone (with a cover on the back) dropped from a distance of 2 feet and the screen is toast. SAMSUNG-Stop rushing to get the product out the door before accessories are available."
5,Love the phone Best Buy techsnicoans very helpful.
5,"I have flipped and flopped over the years with Samsung vs iPhone and I just love this Galaxy. Great pictures, super fast OS, I just love it. Can't wait to get my VR experience!"
5,I really enjoy the phone. Excellent so far amazing camera much better than my S5
5,Great cell phone has more features than my Galaxy 6. Love the infinity screen. Great for watching TV or YouTube. Camera is awesome. Great pictures.
5,Great phone with so much features to explore. If upgrading i highly recommended this phone
4,"So far so good, Samsung is a good product. You will love it"
5,everything is fast and easy to use camera is awesome
5,"Very happy with the new Galaxy S8, great improvement to battery life, lasts all day even with my heavy data usage. Processing speed also great, no lags even with numerous apps loaded and running in background."
5,Great picture and easy to use. Thought I'd miss the physical home button but I don't miss it at all!
5,Does everything advertised. Camera performs well takes great pics!
5,Samsung did a great job with the S8. Super fast and awesome camera!
5,This is a excellent phone. Good quality for the money.
5,"Everything and more....great quality, lots of apps"
5,"Would recommend to anyone. Screen is amazing, and phone is fast."
5,Bought for my wife and she loves it. She says it is the best phone she has ever owned.
5,I upgraded from Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy S8. Best Buy was able to transfer my data to the new phone very quickly and they had valuable info to get me used to the new features. The Galaxy S8 is fantastic looking and performs great.
5,Just got this phone last week. I'm so impressed with it. It's the coolest phone I've ever had. Get one if you are in the market for a new phone.
5,"great new samsung phone, and best buy had the best first day price on it as always."
5,"Great quality camera, works excellent. Love how it works"
5,"This Galaxy 8 is the best! It is easy to hold, easy to use, must I say beautiful.Great deal at Best Buy!"
3,"I love the phone with one exception: Bluetooth performance is pretty poor. Range is terrible, and when riding in my car, I can get the bluetooth signal to cut out simply by covering the phone with my hand. Also, sometimes the ability to control audio on the phone via bluetooth controls (buttons on bluetooth headset or my car steering wheel) will stop working entirely until I restart the phone."
5,THIS PHONE IS AWESOME COMPARED TO ANY IPHONE. BUY IT!
5,Still learning all the new features. No problems at this point other than the curved screen doesn't take a glass protector shield very well.
5,I am enjoying this phone. The camera is an UPGRADE from the one on my S5. I'm sure it has many features I haven't discovered yet.
5,I haven't had this phone long but so far so good. I love the full screen and the picture is so clear and the sound is great too!
5,real nice phone and takes great pictures.really like the full sreen
4,I came from iPhone and things are much better than years ago when I had Android. Moving from iPhone to this had a learning curve but it's overall great.
4,"Battery lasts all day. Only complaint is that the charging cord end was changed from previous Samsung phones so now I have to purchase converters for my car, extra and portable chargers unless i want to buy all new cords. It came with only one converter. I did find some online for cheap so at least I don't have to buy them from Verizon."
5,"Love this phone! Great clarity, speed. Love the camera quality...this was the main reason for purchasing this one."
4,Still trying to learn the many features it has. Setting up bluethtooth speakers was a little confusing but really like the dual audio. Able to play music through 2 speakers at same time.
5,I was an apple user for life and my boyfriend convinced me to switch. It took some getting used to but i love it.
5,Coming from the S7 edge the size and performance of the S8 is amazing. The phone is a little smaller and sleeker. At first I was a little nervous about down sizing in battery size but so far this phone easily lasts all day. I have never felt that I may run out of battery life. Performance wise it exceeds my needs. All around it is the best phone I have ever owned. I would recommend it to any Android user.
4,I like the phone with everything compared with other phones. One thing is that the battery length should be like the s7 that was a down grade to the s8. The process for the promotional products should of been easier especially when you buy more than one product.
4,"My first Samsung phone. Very easy to navigate, fast processing, excellent pictures. Slightly disappointed in t he Bixby debacle...not ready for full use out of the box and the Bixby button placement was not well thought out, but still a pretty awesome phone. Absolutely no issue with the location of the fingerprint scanner."
5,Switched from a iPhone 6 plus and don't regret it at all!!!!
5,"Everything about this phone is awesome. Top of the line specs. The screen is so crisp, clear, and colorful. Comes with 64GB of memory at the start, no need to worry about memory issues. The phone is so fast. You can as many apps open as you want. My wife upgraded to this phone from here original Turbo. She loves it. I am so jealous. I always want to see her phone. Now with the Gear VR, it's even better. If I upgrade soon, I will get this phone."
5,"This is a good update to the Galaxy S7. More screen and the fact that it is narrower is nice for those of us with smaller hands. The fingerprint scanner moved to the back does not seem intuitive at first, but if you couple it with the option to immediately unlock the phone and go to the home screen it works pretty good. You get used to the change quickly."
5,I have not had any issues with Samsung 8 phone. Still learning some features. This is my 3rd Samsung phone and very happy with their products.
5,It was time to upgrade and a good time to do so. Battery life is great.
5,"I love this phone, it is clear, great battery, fast connection speed. And the quick transfer connection allowed me to suck out all my contacts out of my piece of crud iPhone:)"
5,"There is so much going on with S8 that I still don't know all the features it has. Call clarity is amazing, the Bluetooth connection is strong. The infinity screen is the best, Samsung has outdone themselves. Even with a system upgrade, I've had no problem with data or speed of the CPU."
5,My favorite phone so far. They definitely got it right this time.
4,"Whats not to love. Screen, camera, battery, water resistance, Sd card, HDR, TINY bezels, wireless charging, AGK headphones, great sound and great accessories."
4,"Have had no problems with the phone so far, hasn't snow down or froze up durning app switching. As far as battery life goes it get through my day the only time I have to worry about it dying is if I'm playing a lot of games that day with the brightness turned up. The only thing I would change is the placement of the fingerprint sensor it can be hard to reach but after a while I got used to it."
5,"Started looking to upgrade my phone earlier this year. Checked out some of the Moto and LG options at the time (all so huge and bulky!) and decided to wait for the Galaxy S8. So glad I did! The phone is incredibly sleek and comfortable. Similar feel, but overall a huge upgrade from my old Moto X2. Camera is spectacular. Has the newest processor and android version so runs like a dream! Definitely beats the LG G6. I still have difficulty finding the fingerprint sensor or placing my finger just right ...not the best design/placement next to the camera - would have preferred below and centered. But honestly the retina recognition for unlocking works incredibly well even in varying light conditions, through glasses or contacts, etc. Still waiting/hoping for additional bixby features. But overall excellent phone with very few downsides."
5,"Best phone I've ever owned. Crystal clear voice on phone calls, great photos and perfect size. Wish the battery lasted a little longer, but no biggie."
5,"Any issues have been resolved with recent updates. Battery has been excellent, but I'm not a heavy user. Screen is best in the business. Only con I would say is the location of the finger print reader."
3,"Like it , but plan not cheep..
Bit heavy compared to what I'm use to"
3,The camera is a big wonderful improvement and also the speed. I do not like that it is harder to text on this phone. I am currently experiencing issues with my voice not always being heard when I am talking.
5,I've been an avid Android / Samsung customer for years now and they never disappoint!!
5,"Amazing speed, camera works great with stunning pictures!"
5,"Love the storage, the camera size, the color and all the new upgrades. Thank you Samsung!"
5,Love the new color. love the new camera. Love the colors and the battery life.
3,"This is the most feature packed phone ever, and that's it's own downfall. It's not too good on ergonomics, and it's also not the fastest phone out there. I'd either go for the LG G6 or the next Pixel."
5,I truly think this is the best phone I have ever owned. The edges are so useful and not in the way as everyone reported with the S7 Edge. Definitely satisfied with this purchase.
5,I am glad I got this phone. It's fast and camera clear.and the sound is excellent. I got it from preorder. I got the VR. It's fun to watch from VR.
4,"At first the only reason I got the Samsung galaxy 8 was because Samsung makes a great phone and my contract was expiring at the same time. When I got the phone I not super impressed. Then I noticed the button underneath the volume controls, so I pushed it and ""Hello Bixby"" showed up on the screen. Needless to say after playing around with it that program is awesome at knowing my preferences. Also the Bixby vision function on the camera is something that I know everyone who has a smart phone can enjoy. Being able to pull text off of the pic and then to search for that text or translate a foreign language, to shop for that item you just took a pic of, and to be able to find where you are from taking a picture of the landmarks is mind blowing."
5,"The phone is awesome very slim compare to others brand such as the iPhone, Lg, Google, etc. The display is the greatest I seem do far and the phone also fits in ons hand. 
I like that it is wayer resistance and that it had a micro SD card up to 256gb for storing all your music, pictures, movies, etc."
5,"The phone is awesome very slim compare to others brand such as the iPhone, Lg, Google, etc. The display is the greatest I seem do far and the phone also fits in ons hand. 
The thing I don't like is the fingerprint reader on the back, I sometimes have problem opening the phone with my fingerprint. Other than that is the best phone by far."
5,"This is by far the best phone I've ever had the chance to own and operate. I work in mobile IT so I use/test all devices on all OSs, but this is by far the most feature packed phone (actual useful features) ever. The fingerprint scan on the back isn't as bad as it was made out to be (for me) and I have average hands. I use the retina and facial recognition the most, however which is even better. Highly recommended!"
5,"Great phone, it does everything it's supposed to do."
5,"Love the phone, camera is great, screen is crisp. Only thing is I am not a fan of the curved design along the edges, just not my thing."
5,Great upgrade to the s6 edge I had prior to this one. Much faster and better screen quality.
5,So far so perfect!! Excellent battery life. Great camera. Fast. This phone can do a lot more than my s5
5,"good phone as of the moment. good camera, great screen"
4,"I love the Samsung S8 so far. The camera is great and display quality is fantastic. I haven't noticed any negatives, but my only complaint is that I wish it didn't have the curved edges. Just a personal preference. The battery is so much better than my old S6. I can use it all day (5:30a to 10:30p) and have well over 50% remaining before charging at night."
4,Works as expected. Great Android phone. I would recommend.
4,Have only had phone a short time but so far it works great
4,No problems with phone except with those annoying wifi messages
5,"Samsung bloat ware seriously fixed, beautiful display, super fast."
5,new phone.. easy to use... works good .. love the camera
5,Very pleased with the Galaxy S8. It is definitely an innovative device. Looking forward to what Samsung unveils next.
5,The camera on this phone is amazing! Such a difference coming from the Galaxy S5. Battery life is also much better on the S8.
5,"Upgraded from my galaxy s6 to this. Awesome phone. The look and feel of the phone. Slim design awesome screen. Very nice upgrades in battery size, camera, infinity screen display, and still able to slide in pockets comfortable in u choose to"
5,"Great phone. No issues. The screen is very clear and the battery life is much improved over my last phone (over a day, even with heavy streaming)."
4,"This phone seems to have so many features, i havn't even tried them all. I think it will be a phone to have for years of great fun, especially with the camera! I like durability and having to worry about not only the glass front but also the back?! so much for looking good till it drops and cracks, and if you protect it with a case then you don't even see the back of the phone. 
Otherwise a Great phone!"
5,I got this phone for my husband. He had a Samsung S3 years ago and then made the switch to iPhone. This phone's screen is worth the swap back to Android.
5,"This phone is perfect, screen size, camera and speed of the phone glad I bought it"
4,Great phone wish they would have offered it without the rounded edges. I'm not a fan but it's ok.
5,Samsung has done it again! The Samsung galaxy s8 has better features than the 6 and 7.
5,"This is an awesome phone. We bought it for our son so that he would have a good phone for boarding school. It takes beautiful pictures, has an above-average battery life, expandable storage and is an all-around beautiful phone."
5,"This is an awesome phone. We bought it for our daughter so that she would have a good phone for college. It takes beautiful pictures, has an above-average battery life, expandable storage and is an all-around beautiful phone."
4,The S8 screen helped me to forget my iPhone 6. The 64GB space and expandable memory finally helps me to load the Netflix movies and shows without the dreaded out of space messages on my Apple.
5,"I NEVER get the next new phone when it comes out. Usually because of price & any ""tweaks"" that may be needed after a new release. I would just buy the version PRIOR to the new release, so I was always one upgarde behind. Not this time. Samsung S8 was too nice and for the same monthly fee, I got it PLUS a neat Gear VR ! Best decision I ever made. So glad I went to Best Buy for this upgrade. Better deals than VZW !"
5,"I love the new Galaxy 8 phone, the camera is fabulous, and takes great pictures!"
5,Changed from an Apple phone to a Samsung and I'm very happy i did! It works great and is so fast!
5,Better than the iPhone 7 with excellent HD resolution
5,"The S8 is such a great phone, the form factor is light and the display is amazing. I even like where they placed the finger print ID on the back of the phone as it is very easy to use."
5,"The S8 is such a great phone, the form factor is light and the display is amazing. I even like where they placed the finger print ID on the back of the phone as it is very easy to use."
5,Great new features on this phone. Battery life a lot better. Fantastic camera. Memory is huge.
5,had LG now this one and love it easy to use and charge lasts a long time
5,"Very responsive, great picture and fits great in my hand. Very happy with this phone."
5,This is more than a phone...I call it my personal electronic device!
3,I switched to a Samsung from having Motorola phones for a decade because of horrible customer service. I waited weeks for the S8 releaseand was impressed with the screen and the slim drsign. However I've been really disappointed with the number of cslls dropped.
5,Great phone very intuitive and takes great pictures
5,Awesome phone good Battery excellent camera and over all great phone.
5,What a gorgeous phone. I absolutely love it! So much faster and more sleek than my last one!I live it....love it!
5,"I must admit I am an avid Samsung phone purchaser so I do have high expectations for their phone. As soon as I got my new S8, it didn't take long for me to see and feel this phone was going to be a winner. I haven't really used Bixby yet but plan to start soon. I am on this phone a lot for work and personal matters. The battery life has been true to the reports."
5,This phone works very well. My son loves his new phone because of the style.
4,Great handheld device! I love the new features and the great looks!
5,"Fast, reliable, best battery life ever. I haven't needed to plug this this during the day since I bought it. I use it from 6am to 11pm every day with no problems. Best Galaxy yet!"
5,"Fast, reliable, best battery life ever. I haven't needed to plug this this during the day since I bought it. I use it from 6am to 11pm every day with no problems. Best Galaxy yet!"
5,"All around outstanding phone. Camera is great. Screen is gorgeous. Feels light in the hands. Slimer than S6. Fast. Setup was very easy. Only complaint is the face recognition doesn't work well in dim light, and the finger print scanner on the back is a little awkward."
5,"Love the new product, easy process purchasing online through best buy. The has new built in swipe features that make the user function so much better, it's hard to compare to my S5."
5,"Frankly, I am not usually on the cutting edge, but this phone is definitely all that and the above. I was upgrading from the S4, so this phone has been quite the upgrade for me. WQHD screen resolution to go along with the infinity screen is simply amazing. Battery performance has been excellent. No complaints...

Look forward to seeing what Bixby might add to the phone."
4,good all around phone and better than the s7 edge.
5,Phone is great. Great camera. Big upgrade from my old S4.
5,"Upgraded to the S8 from Galaxy S7 and couldn't be happier. The phone has an outstanding display, is fast and so far has great battery life. No cons so far."
5,"This phone is very beautiful. The display is so clear and vivid, and the whole infinity screen is awesome. It's everything you expect from a galaxy."
4,"Not that it couldn't be better. Face recognition worked really well until the phone had it's first update now it rarely works. The lighting has to be close to what it was when you made your sample. The phone is fast and takes really good pictures, the screen is really nice and I love the rounded edges. It is wanting to do another major update and I am putting it off. My data limit suffers from updates on this phone so far."
4,"It reminds me very much of my note 7. So much so,that I wish I had it back. Battery life is pretty decent, much better than s7 edge. Feels much like the note 7 in the hand, very comfortable. I miss the stylus though.
Fingerprint reader is not in a good location so unlocking while laying on a desk is cumbersome.it loses a full star for that."
4,This phone has all kinds of stuff to do with the camera. My wife and daughter loves it.
5,"I've have had the Samsung Galaxy S8 for about a month now and absolutely love it. The only thing I would change, would be to bring back the home button. It's hard to find it, because there is not an actual button, just a spot on the screen. Otherr than that, great phone!!"
5,I've had every galaxy. This is by far the best phone samsung has launched. Looks great feels great and performs like a champ. Battery is incredible
5,Works good it's great having all the new features....
4,I miss having expandable storgae4. Pictures look great in the infinity display.
5,Love the look and the feel of the phone. Fast and smooth
5,"I finally got my Samsung Galaxy S8, this thing is amazing, more than what I expected. if you can get one, I would recommend it."
5,"Had a note for many years, wanted to change up. I like my choice"
5,This phone operates so smooth and effortless 10 stars
5,I cant say enough about this phone best galaxy yet!
5,Awesome phone. I cannot wait for the next model. They keep getting better.
5,It's a great device. The camera is superior. Love the vr!
5,Awesome screen easy to use like the size.like the bixby features.just wish the screen protectors would work.
5,I previously had a Galaxy S5 and patiently waited for a phone that seemed like an actual Upgrade to me. The S8 is definitely that. The screen is larger and clearer than the S5. I love the rapid charging and the speed of the phone. I also like the infinity edge. It is lightweight and very comfortable to use in one hand. I love my S8.
5,"Bought this phone, as soon as it came out, to replace an older Samsung phone and the layout of the phone is very easy to navigate. The camera options are great"
5,"Some phones are too big, and some are too small. This one is ""just right"" and very powerful."
5,I was an avid iphone user and decided to switch to the samsung s8...Mostly because of the memory and camera that it has...Great phone...Glad I made the switch...very easy to switch..No problems
5,"This phone is one of the best I've ever used! Great battery, amazing speeds, beautiful screen! Highly recommend!"
5,"I have been an owner of the Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 and now the S8. I really love the phone, simplicity, intuitiveness and overall performance. I have had a Samsung phone for over six years and wouldn't go with any other brand."
5,"The beauty of this phone is exceptional. The device has a large QHD display, but packages it in a slim and sleek phone with excellent battery life. The S8 is also very powerful and completes tasks with ease. Great job Samsung."
5,"Love the new design and the bigger screen. Some of the new additions took some getting used to, but love the phone!"
5,"I switched from a iPhone 6S. This phone has put Apple in it's place. Sleek design, powerful components, and VR to top it off. How could you not! One thing that does take some getting used to is the on screen keyboard and placement of the fingerprint scanner."
5,"This phone is beautiful, powerful, and a pleasure to carry. The battery lasts much longer than the S7, even without having to turn off GPS or turning on the battery saver. So far, I have no complaints and plenty of praise."
5,A solid feeling phone with a gorgeous display. Much faster than my old Samsung Galaxy S6. Tons of storage especially with a micro-sd card. Incredible camera. The infinity screen is just absolutely awesome. The best phone on the market right now.
5,Love this phone. Easy to use and love theboverside screen.
5,I came over from an Iphone 7 plus and after using this phone ill probably never switch back.
4,So far I'm really enjoying my new S8 It's a lot different from my 7 the pictures are perfect. Its has a lot of cool features that I'm LOVEEE IN
5,I went from an S4 to the S8. So far very pleased with everything.
5,Really glad I stayed with Samsung. I was thinking about switching to something else due to all the trouble but this S8 is so cool. Still learning new things after a couple weeks. No problems yet.
5,Amazing phones and amazing battery life. You can customize it to make it yours unlock the icrap and taking pictures are awesome and the screen is amazing
5,We have the s8 and s8+ and both work way better than previous s7. Battery life is a big improvement. Smooth and quick.
5,"As a long time user of Samsung Galaxy phones I was very impressed by this phone the second I took it out of the box. The build quality is incredible, very stylish. Only gripe is the price tag but honestly you get what you pay for. Best phone out there hands down. Full disclosure my work phone is an iphone 6s, and I prefer the S8 by a long shot."
5,"Samsung has far exceeded the expectations with this phone. After the note 7 fiasco, company has produced a masterpiece. The looks make an iPhone feel like an ordinary block. Fast speed, crisp colors and extraordinary camera overall make the experience above par in comparison to other phones available in the market. A must buy"
5,"I love this phone and all the features, the battery lasts forever the camera takes beautiful pictures and the ability to add extra memory is definitely a plus. The only downside is that feature of Bixsby but I believe they'll have that corrected later hopefully."
5,"I previously had a galaxy s5 and and s3 and s2 prior to this phone. This phone has worked out a lot of kinks in the preloaded Samsung apps on previous models. The battery on this phone is shockingly long lasting. I use the phone to stream music at work fgor 9 hours a day and only use about 15% of the battery. The all glass design gives it a luxury feel to it. The always on display is nice to check the time with. I wasn't sure how I'd like the removal of the home button, but surprisingly, it's one of the best things about this phone. I bought this phone for myself and within a week, I was buying 2 more for my wife and son. I would and have recommend this phone to anyone. If you're an iPhone user,iwouldsuggrst giving this phone a try. I also have an iPhone for work and this is hands down the best phone on the market today."
5,"Awesome display. Ok battery life but with I screen like this, I'm not surprised. The glass does tend to get tiny superficial scratches in the coating on it which annoys me. Overall I do like it."
5,After owning an apple phones for 12 years there is a learning curve for android. This a GREAT phone.
5,"Love my new Samsung S8. Beautiful screen ... high quality ""build"" ... and the thing is FAST! Plus my battery lasts MUCH longer than my S6 ... often ending the day with 30% or more battery without any mid-day charging. Love it!"
5,"Coming from iPhone I was unsure how much I would like the phone. I have to say I'm impressed how far Android has come, I don't regret my decision in switching to Galaxy. The display it's incredible!!!!"
5,I purchased this for my wife and can't he can't say enough good things about it!
5,Great Android phone. Super features. Highly recommend.
5,Fast phone. Great battery life. Beautiful screen and design. Definitely the best phone out at the moment
5,Before this Samsung I was a big HTC fan couldn't be happier with the Samsung S8
5,I have had a galaxy since they have first came out and would not buy any other kind
5,Great phone with a great camera. Easy to use as well
5,I have had many phones but this phone is great. It connects with all my devices easy and is tough
5,"The phone was everything I expected and more...so if you need or want a great phone, this is it."
5,The speed and processing power is great and the camera rocks!!
4,This is my 5th Galaxy phone and by far the best one yet. The infinity screen is nothing short of amazing and while the camera isn't a substantial improvement over the S7 it is still one of the best cameras you can get in a phone.
5,"Fast, Responsive and full of great features. Would recommend to someone looking for a cutting edge media device."
5,I like the size of the phone. Am still learning about it but so far am impressed by the ease of use.
5,"This isa great upgrade from the S7. The S8 plus just didn't fit or need as it was just too long. Negative....if you were never one for the edge model, your out of luck. They are all edge now."
3,"I have purchased the new S8 and am having difficulty learning how to use it. I hope that someone can assist me with it.
Instructions would be helpful."
5,i highly recommend the samsung galaxy s8 to everyone
5,Love my gs8 has the power I need to run anything including my home automation. The gs8 does not skip a beat . Size is perfect and camera is awesome . Can't say enough food things.
5,"This latest Samsung Galaxy version is faster and has a brighter screen than the previous versions. It takes a little time to get used to the lack of physical Home, Back and Task Manager buttons."
5,I love my new phone. It takes great pictures. Is easier to use than I thought.
4,Very happy with my purchase. Glad I purchased this product at best buy
5,Samsung knocked it out of the park with Galaxy 8. Best cell phone ever. Full of new features. Love the infinity screen.
5,"This is very similar to my previous phone, S6, but way better!! The ease of use and lack of buttons is great! The expandable memory option is necessary! I love the always on screen for the time and to check statuses without turning the phone all the way on!"
4,"The phone is great so far, hopefully it continues!"
4,The 8 has a bigger screen than the 6. Has some of the same features. Battery life lasts longer.
5,"I was a long time Motorola phone user - but oddly was never happy with them. I loved the look and feel of the phones, but the performance lacked. I switched to an S4 way back when, and was impressed with the performance. Then on to an S6, now the S8. The S8 is the best of the bunch performance wise. And it's waterproof (mostly) again. Screen and camera are simply amazing. If I had one complaint, it would be that you can only choose the curved screen - I'd prefer the flat screen for simplicity with screen protectors and cases. Otherwise, Samsung hit it out of the park."
5,This phone is great. It works great and the 64g storage is ample with the additional storage slot. The phokne doesn't feel big but it looks huge. Love it.
5,"Having owned Motorola's and galaxy S3&5, the S8 is a huge jump up. The speed, screen size and feel are awesome. Battery lasts all day with heavy use. Hands down a better phone."
5,"User friendly, nice large screen. GREAT camera. Highly recommended."
5,"So far, so good...I like that removable storage is an option with this version."
5,I like the camera and the new features of the phone.
5,"Good for small hands. Easy to use. Edge feature is not annoying like the other ""edge"" phones. Easy to navigate. Battery last a long time. Good graphics and sounds. Highly recommend even for first time android users."
4,"I upgraded from an S7 and it's a step up. I really like the finger print sensor on the back. The edge send like a gimmick, but it didn't really get in the way."
5,PHONE HAS BEEN GREAT SO FAR. GLAD I BOUGHT IT. GET ONE.
5,So far my Samsung galaxy 8 has been great! Love the screen size and all the extras highly recommended
5,Great item for the way I use my phone. Easy to use.
4,Love the screen quality and keyboard. Has some minor flaws that are being addressed through updates.
5,"Amazing camera, crisp screen plenty of memory, battery life is good. Pleasant upgrade from S5."
5,"Love getting a big screen on a phone that is easy to handle. No Bixby really doesn't matter, because I use Google anyway."
5,The Galaxy S8 is the best phone on the market today. It gives you more customization than the iPhone and compared to other Android flagship phones it has the best screen and a great camera that makes it stand out above the competition. Battery life is actually pretty good. I'm usually able to make it through an entire day without needing to recharge.
5,"Loving my Samsung 8 so far! Was happy to get lower monthly payments by purchasing from Best Buy. Great customer service, and a free wireless phone charger as an add-on!"
5,This phone is amazing. It works so well and have not had any problems with it yet!
5,Got a get deal I love this phone easy to use I love how its not bulky
5,"Phone was everything I had hoped for. The wide, curved screen is nice for watching videos. Also, when the phone is upside down, the screen is visible from the edges. I really like that. A lot of features that I'm still finding out."
5,Have had Samsung phones since day one and am very happy with the S8 phone. The S8+ was too large. So many upgrades which I do not use. Can be overwhelming but I guess that is technology for you!
5,I am still learning how to use this device but so far so good. I really loved the S7 Note and was so sad to have to give it up. I hope that this phone does all that Samsung claims it will. So far so good on my end.
5,"I have been a samsung fan for many years now and have owned the gs4 and gs6 edge, the gs8 is incredible and doesn't disappoint. The finger print sensor is not as big of an issue as people are making it out to be. It works fantastic and the phone itself is stunning and super fast. Hasn't lagged or hick-up'd since I've had it. I got this on April 21st and love it... if you're looking for something great, this is it."
5,Fast speed. Great camera and screen is large and durable. Only bad thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner on the back.
5,"Fast, very compact and great new features, fairly new so we will see how it goes"
5,"Awesome phone, takes amazing pictures and I like thin body"
5,I purchased this phone for my daughters to replace the S5. They love the new features and new look. The phone is fast and last all day.
5,"This phone is fast, clear and light. I love it. Lots of fun."
5,The S8 is a great phone with lots of features and the display is good. The features/settings are a lot easier to learn and set up then the previous S6 and back.
5,"This phone is great love the camera on it, feels good on ur hands and very easy set up for everything I'm just loving this new phone"
5,"Couldn't be happier with this product. Super easy to use, amazing pictures and very sleek"
5,Great phone love all features switched from my iphone it's great
3,"Pre-ordered and purchased S8 about 3 weeks ago. Phone has a great screen and runs clean, at least it did. Recently it has been randomly rebooting. I googled ""Galaxy S8 random reboot problem"", and this seems to be a pretty common problem among S8 owners. Samsung has not admitted yet that there is a problem with this, but if you look at their support site it is full of complaints of this happening. Most have not found anything that corrects the problem. In fact many people reported getting the phone replaced and have the same problem with the new phone. I think this is the last time I will get in on the front end of a new product."
5,This phone is simply beautiful. It has everything you can ask for in a phone and more. the multi tasking ability is fun to operate.
5,This phone is a great one!!! At first there is some new features I could not figure out right away but after using it I am very impressed. The screen quality is excellent. Beautiful phone!
5,I love the new s8 so much. I had the s6 before I purchased the s8. The new s8 screen is awesome. This phone is so much faster at opening apps compared to my s6. Battery life is excellent. Get the s8 you will not be disappointed.
5,This is Samsung's best phone yet. I've had many of they galaxy versions this is hands down my favorite. If you have a tendency to be rough with your phone you will probavly want insurance. The screen is amazing but I imagine it would break fairly easy if dropped.
5,This is the best galaxy phone yet. It has a longer battery life than the s6 i was using. I can't wait till Bixby is released to see what it can do.
5,"I like the new infinity screen more than I anticipated. Same Android features, etc. Great camera and fast."
5,I really like this S8. User friendly n many extras.
5,It's an awesome phone you can do so much with the phone
5,Moving from my s6 was a breeze. I even retained my wifi passwords and personalized background picture.
5,"Works great. Battery life seems good. Curved screen and no physical ""home"" button is taking a little getting used to."
5,I was definitely in need of an upgrade considering I had an S4 still. This phone was exactly what I was looking for. Great all around phone so far. Excellent camera and picture. Huge screen but the phone fits comfortably in my hand.
5,Love the phone very fast and durable. The only thing is I don't know what the edge button does.
5,Great phone. Very sleek. Runs multiple apps very smoothly. 4k video! Beautiful phone...I can go on and on.
5,upgraded from the S7 to the S8. So far easy to use and looking forward to trying out the VR.. one thing I found out was the VR used on the S7 doesn't fit the S8.
5,My first Samsung phone after a history with LG. Best looking phone I've ever had. Very slippery though. Get a case!!
5,Finally replaced my HTC08. This was a perfect replacement. Infinity screen is awesome. Processor is very fast. Phone is a little expensive but I got it somewhat on sale in Best Buy. The pre-order bonuses also is worth it.
5,Best Phone i have every own. Love everything about it.
5,I love the design and IRIS scanner works well. I have no problem using the fingerprint scanner in the back.
4,The phone itself is excellent but I went back to iPhone because it and I couldn't get along. This is an excellent item if you can handle Android.
5,Case sparkles and protects. My wife loves it more than any other case she has had in the past.
4,"It fit the phone perfect, was easy to install. Great product."
5,"This is my second Samsung device after galaxy S2 and I have been using this phone for a little while than 2 weeks and here are my findings

PROS: 
1. First thing that catches your attention is the infinity screen
2. 18.5 : 9 body ratio that can be easily caught in a single hand without any hassle. 
3. Good battery backup that last a whole day on medium usage. 
4. Quick charge, that charges your phone from 0 to full charge in 90 minutes
5. Water resistant which i tried in a pool for 20 minutes.

There are many more but, these are three most important ones

CONS:
1. Phone gets too much heated on heavy usage like gaming
2. Too much Samsung and Verizon (Carrier related) bloatware which we may not use and uses up the space.
3. Long run may reduce the efficiency of the phone. 

These are all i could say about the phone now... Will keep you updated on my further usage"
5,"Slim, light. Display and picture quality is awesome. Perfect size and great price. And it's not Apple product"
4,My daughter got a new Galaxy S8 and says it is much better than the S5. Faster and holds more apps.
5,"I really like this phone, it's fast and intuitive. I'm not super into the curved screens, though-- but I guess that's just how it goes now. Sometimes it makes it easier to accidently open up apps that are on the perimeter. I originally didn't like the Always on Display, but now I find it much easier to wake the phone up if I have that.
all in all, I'm glad I purchased this phone."
5,The S8 has everything I've come to love about samsung plus many more features.
3,Not loving the phone yet. HUGE learning curve. Not sure if I will keep it or go back to my Iphone
5,"Just got done taking this phone on an Alaskan cruise, and the camera performed way beyond expectations!"
4,"The phone was suggested to me by Best Buy employees. I like it very much, but there are some aspects that are different from my last phone. However, I chose Samsung because there people at Best Buy who are able to answer questions or give tutorials on Samsung products."
5,I am very happy with my new Galaxy S8. It looks amazing and has all the features you would want in the latest smartphone.
2,"I think there are to many updates all the time, and the phone is actually smaller than my old one. 
I don't like that I have to come in and take class to learn something"
5,This is a great phone and I have no problems with it.
4,"I updated my old Galaxy for the storage. Great color. The battery life isn't what I hoped it would be, but it's a good phone"
5,Love this phone- no issues! Super fast and holds a battery all day!
5,Great phone. Sleek and stylish. Easy to learn and use.
4,"Beautiful design, solid performance, and faster phone I ever had. I will explore more to find other features."
3,"It drops calls, and the auto correct is irritating and the voice to text is bad. 
Pictures are goof, and speed is good"
5,"I have to start out by saying I was long over due for a new phone. My last phone was a Galaxy 5. I put it off thinking not that much would be different. Boy was I wrong. Yes, tge set up is basically the same, but a lot of the features are a big upgrade. I love the crystal clear screen, camera, security features, and Bixby!"
5,"Love this case feels good in hand. Also the top and bottom of this case has a nice lip that raises the front glass from touching a flat surface, yet still thin and top notch protection."
5,the size and the look of this phone is just perfect for my wife. She loves this phone.
5,"The galaxy s8 is AMAZING!!!! if your in the market to purchase a phone, dont look any further. This is the phone you want. Beautiful display , battery life is great, and most importantly its really fast. The camera takes incredible pictures. Its truly an amazing devoce"
3,"This is my first Samsung phone and first time away from iPhone since 2012. I've had this phone since shortly after it came out so its been a couple of months. I gave it 3 stars because I bet if you're used to android it's an awesome upgrade. There is just too many things that are difficult making the switch from iPhone to Samsung, and I use Google for many things on my iPhone.

The phone is cool and for the most part it works ok. It's cool having widgets that are functional but certain apps don't function well like Transit but that's an app problem.

The cons that warrant 3 stars from me:
I keep having trouble with voice assist turning on with some magical button press and it's a serious pain to turn it off. Nothing gets done while it's on. Why would a vision assistant need to turn on and off with quick buttons anyway? Either you can see or you can't. 

The phone also seems to reset previous settings i've already had. The volume sync needs to be redone with devices i've already connected to like my car and headphones, but it's not predictable to me yet. Sometimes it keeps, sometimes it doesn't. Palm swipe for screen capture turns off regularly as well. 

Bixby was just activated and it's not very helpful. Stick with Google assistant.

The place where the home button would be doesn't always work for me to turn the screen on. That's unnerving.

I had difficulty with the contacts syncing over google and all of my contacts with iPhones could not be used. It seemed to be tied to the area code being in parenthesis. Maybe this is an android problem.

I would not recommend switching to this phone if you were looking to get away from iPhone after some time. It's challenging."
3,Like usual Samsung overhyped this phone to be the best thing since sliced bread so I figure I tried it against my better judgment because every time I've tried a Samsung device I've been disappointed. And after using it for a few days it constantly got slower and slower because of the hundreds of bloatware garbage apps running in the background that Samsung loads the phone up with that you can't remove making it sluggish and not near as good as my iPhone 7 which I just returned it for and went back to.
2,This phone has some cool features but it is so slow to load anything I am only giving it 2 stars. Also the widgets constently move to different locations and a lot of time an app has two icons on the same screen. Can't get past how slow it is. So annoying.
4,"I have a few questions, but I am headed to Best Buy today to get a little assistance from one of the very professional specialist."
4,I really like the phone so far. I would recommend this phone.
4,This phone is easy to use. It has a clear screen view and takes outstanding pictures.
4,Love it no complaints yet. Love the size and screen quality
4,"I found that they made the extra edge on the phone has no use. I did not use the edge. I like the quality of the sound. I did not try the camera yet. I am still in a process of learning how to use this phone. So far, I like this phone."
5,Samsung G8 is the best phone that steals away the heart.
5,"This phone is fast and have good stuff on it if you a samsung fan you,ll like"
5,Absolutely love this phone! The screen looks amazing and the added features like Bixby are Great! Battery life so far is amazing! Love the iris scan to unlock the phone. Runs faster and smoother
1,The phone gets stuck soo much I'm not sure if I got a defected phone or what but no one can hear me on my speaker and Bluetooth
4,Have had Samsung's for a while. S7 had software/ battery issues. Software issues went away. Now my phone just has battery issues.
5,"Everything is working great so far. It is super fast and smooth. It's beautiful. It charges really fast. The camera is excellent and has a lot of different filters to choose from. Sound quality is great. I also like how Samsung is so customizable! Aside from that, I'm thankful that I didn't buy the screen protector. I hope they fix that soon :)"
1,"I liked my Samsung 6, much better. 
Easier to learn how to work the phone. 6 was easier to move apps around, remove, like certain games, apps, the Samsung 8 Even after going back to Best Buy meeting with a Samsung Rep. He too had to ask for help."
1,Not even two weeks old and the screen turned green and it won't charge. Had to shut down before it dies completely and no one can see what's wrong. Going without a phone all weekend until I can get to Best Buy on Monday. Loved it until this happened.
1,"Nice phone but not as good as an iPhone. Takes great photos, very light weight."
1,I bought a s8 it's a beautiful phone but I dropped it less than 3ft in a new otter box and the back glass broke because the whole phone is glass! BEST BUY ONLY HAS A 14 DAY RETURN PERIOD ON CELL PHONES AND THIS HAPPENED ON THE 17TH DAY. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER
1,Hated the phone... Best buy locked our Verizon account it took 6 calls and 4 visits to get this mess cleaned up. Went back to Verizon to upgrade.
2,"Love the phone, but don't drop it. We were waiting for the case to come in the mail and my wife dropped it from a table on the corner and broke the screen under the screen protector...not impressed with durability at all."
5,"I debated for a long time and never ended up preordering it. I wish I would have because the free VR woulda been awesome. I swapped from years of iPhone use so there has been a learning curve with android, however, the pho e and OS have been awesome. The phone feels solid. Great screen and fast fast fast processing speed. The only downfall I see so far is the battery life, which is on par with my old iPhone, not better. The iris scanner has a few short comings but overall works better than anticipated. I highly recommend this phone and look forward to apples response to it."
1,Makes screen useless..took it off after 2 days. Don't waste your money
1,"i just spent a bunch of money on the S8 that was supposed to be the greatest phone ever shatter proof water proof all of that, but turns out the phone will shatter in your pocket, now im stuck with an expensive broken phone that im sure isnt water proof anymore because the shatter proof screen broke the second day i had it"
1,I just got my new Galaxy S8 and it won't always let me answer calls. What good is a phone if you can't answer calls on it. I love everything else about the phone but need to answer calls.
1,"I saw my younger son accidentally walk into my older son (owner of the phone) and saw the phone take a simple little 1.5 ft drop at the most onto the sidewalk. The screen cracked in 2 corners, glass broke off and a big crack going diagonally across the screen. I drop my iPhone a half dozen times every single day and in 1.5 yrs, have not broken the screen and it's taken some bag drops, falls and kicked around. My son wanted this phone for one of the reasons being its durability. Ya right"
4,This phone to me has a few cons. My hands are small so I can not reach the finger print scanner with one hand so I can't use it. The iris scanner is kind of weird to use because you have to hold your phone up in front of your face. People look at you weird when you go it. The face scanner has been the most successful. The screen is amazing. You have to go in to the setting and enable to use the whole screen in each app it does not automatically use the whole screen. Bixby doesn't work to well but I'm told it will the more I use it. The phone it's self if longer and slimmer than my previous s6 edge. I'm a little disappointed that the face and iris scanner will not work in low lights so at night I have to unlock it with a code.
5,This is the best phone I have ever had it's great looks awesome don't hesitate buy this phone you won't regret it
1,Returned. Husband disliked very much. Would not recommend.
1,"I bought samsung s8 from my local best buy store. After few days realized s8+ will be better for me. Went to return, verizon has 14 days return policy, I was 1/2 day over, they refused and said see if best buy could take store return. The sales guy who was helping sent an email to store manager, it was Sunday. I never heard back. I am a physician, had limited time only on weekend to go and do this. The return policy should be 30 days, these are complex devices, it's not possible to learn all within 2 weeks or make decision if you are busy."
1,"I am very unhappy with this phone, nothing but problems."
1,"I pre ordered this phone due to best buy / samsung employee telling me about the 99 dollar full immersive package. So I went to best buy multiple times to play with the S8 which is 30+ mins away mind you and than eventually returned the Lg g6 ( which was actually a great phone 5 hrs sot fantastic screen and camera) . My thinking was that finally Samsung and best buy got it together to make things right over the note 7 / s7e issues. I actually had issues with multiple S7E. Well it turned out that package was already sold out before best buy even had the phones. I was so excited until I paid for the phone and than after the phone was mine the best buy employee said that package was out. So I was duped from the get go from best buy and samsung, thinking that I was going to get this deal . Shame on them to drive pre orders up and trick the consumers.

So onto the phone.. Phone is literally the same as s7e in a skinnier more awkward frame and smaller battery. The camera is actually the same piece of hardware, finger print scanner is still slow compared to other manufacturers and in a weird spot, already got finger prints all over the camera. As matter of fact besides looks and all the samsung programs I wont actually use since they waste battery life the LG G6 is a much better buy and overall phone. How ever the audio output is def better then the S7E out of the jack, and I hear the Bluetooth is better too."
