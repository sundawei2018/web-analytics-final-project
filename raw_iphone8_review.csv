5,"Phone works great. Features are different than previous phones (I had a really old one), but I got used to it quickly."
5,"Chose this phone for my wife over the iPhone X. Works like previous models, no issues thus far."
5,This is a beautiful phone but if you have the 7 wait to upgrade. My daughter had the 6 and we needed the 64 GB of storage that comes standard with this phone. There is almost no difference between the 7 and the 8 other than the better camera and the glass finished back. It is a great phone though if you are upgrading from a 6.
5,"The iPhone 8 is a blend of old-school and new-school feel and design. You'll find many of the same features from the iPhone 4, 5 and 6 built in this model. What stands out to me is the progression of the technology and the need to access information more accurately. The iPhone achieves this goal. A++ overall."
5,This is exactly like every other phone. It’s really great. I can’t wait to post what I’m eating for dinner.
5,Could not have waited any longer...this phone is superlative in all aspects. Everyone should buy this Apple...
5,"IOS 11 is amazing and since I've upgraded from a (6s) to the (8) I have absolutely no regrets. Overall great, reliable, and fast phone."
3,"I like the iPhone 8, but it seems like you have to do an update more frequently than any iPhone I have had in the past"
4,"Upgraded from iPhone 6s and the battery lasts much longer, great product overall, just the new iOS was crashing, all fixed now"
5,"So far, so good with the iPhone 8. Battery lasts a long time compared to old iPhone."
5,I have had the iphone since it came out in 2007 and have always been a fan. got this 1 for the kids and the X for my wife and myself. love the picture quality and the sound that comes from the phone it is even better on the X and it is so fast. Truly one of the best.

5,Easy to use. Love the camera and all the features.
5,I used dated blackberry for years. I love the pictures
5,Just updated from a 5S after several years. This phone has a great size screen and a great speaker. So much easier to hear.
5,"I love my new iPhone8. It is amazing, everything I ever wanted. The display is beautiful. I feel bad for everyone without one."
1,I didn’t get reward points for this. Please transfer reward points
5,Love all the upgrades made to the new iPhone. Life is better
5,Phone works good and has a lot of newer features. Verizon is the best carrier.
5,"I had a 6 and when that died because of water damage, upgrading to the 8 was easy and simple. Other than a few minor upgrades it’s basically the same as the iPhone6 which I loved so this was a no brainer. A big plus is that the 8 is water resistant and see above why that is a big deal!"
4,Hope battery lasts longer than 6s has recently. Like the updated camera features.
4,Like the updated camera features. Hope the battery hold charge longer than old phone.
2,I bought 2. One was defective out of the box. Had to buy another and wait for my credit on the defective one. Thought seriously about switching to a droid. Wish i had of. Reload from the icloud did not go well. Very poor work by Apple! Very didappointed
5,"The iPhone 8 is an amazing upgrade from my old iPhone 6. I loved the form factor of the 6 so I’m very happy that the 8 is almost identical in this regard. 

The TouchID is a LOT better than it was on the 6. It unlocks almost instantly, and it recognizes my fingerprint much more often then my 6 has been."
5,Very happy with this phone and all of the improvements to it.
5,This was a much needed upgrade for me and it more than meets my expectations. Love this phone!
5,"Easy to navigate, larger memory, screen is easy to read"
5,Has a larger memory than my iphone 5. Easy to navigate
5,Got to replace a iPhone 6. Very happy w phone and amount of storage.
5,Well its iphone!! i definitely recommend X if you like iOS
5,The new IPhone 8 is a great upgrade to my old IPhone 6s plus. The camera is amazing along with many new features and enhancements.
5,Must have. Best iPhone yet. Best size and functions!
5,"I switched from Samsung to my first ever iPhone. I love the size. I do not like how big all the other phones are getting, so I hope Apple continues to offer this size and quality."
5,Does exactly what it says it does. Great product for the money!
5,Watta design and camera is awesome. Just lacking portrait on front camera except that phone is awesome
5,My new i8 is great! I was very happy with the store's employees. Very helpful and fast!
5,This phone has an easy to hold size. I love the graphics in the apps
5,"Yep, had to do it. Bought my first smart IPhone and am very pleased thus far. Feels good and performs great. Still have a lot to learn but what great fun."
5,"Great phone... look I know many people don’t understand the difference between 7 and 8, and saying that why you would just get the x... well that’s the thing it’s all relative! The phone you love is not bast one fancy features... it’s based on you! I love this phone and my husband loves those old flip phones that don’t do anything lol it’s just preference! So... 7? 8? X? Who cares? You... only you...!"
5,iPhone hasn’t let me down. Not many new upgrades on this phone from my 6s that I have noticed. I am just a basic user pictures/text/calls/ and a few apps
4,"I switched to Apple from Samsung for convenience. My car is Apple friendly. It sounded like a good reason at the time. I'm happy with the phone, battery life, apps and so forth ... I just prefer Samsung over Apple. If you're an Apple lover ... you'll love this phone."
5,Great phone as always. We had an iPhone 6 before and the upgrade to the 8 is amazing. So much faster. Super happy with it.
4,"Great phone, glad to be away from the large plus size! Battery life seemed better on the plus, but I still get over a day on this one, so nothing to be concerned about!"
5,Good phone but too expensive to carry around. Not sure if it's worth it.
5,Another great iteration of the IPhone ... mostly just faster than it’s previous models
5,Fast. Accurate and just the best one ever. I love the new non push button. It is so easy and accurate
5,"Availability of all the phones with all the color options and storage capacities. Best service. 
Overall great experience."
5,The iPhone 8 is great. The ease in function and the camera are the selling points
5,Very stylish and easy to use. Definitely faster and pore responsive than previous models.
5,I love my new Apple Iphone 8. The camera on the new phone is amazing. the clarity of the pics look like they were taken on a proffesional camera. Above all the experience itself was fantastic. Kaylee was my sales representative and could not have been better.
4,Still familiarizing myself with the new features. No complaints so far.
3,iPhone 8 is just an updated 6S. Should have waited on X
4,"I went for the IPhone SE to this one. I have no complaints. Is it much better than the SE? No, but it has much more room given I had the 16gb SE, and I really loved my SE. The 8 has been pretty reliable so far, and it does have a few features my SE did not have."
5,"Got this phone as a replacement for the iPhone SE which had screen issues. So far, it's working great."
4,"Just received thus item in the last 2 weeks. Son wanted the plus, but he's 12 so he doesn't get a choice. Other than him being grumpy about a smaller phone, he loves it. Says it has way better features than the 6s he had upgraded from"
5,No problems so far I like the new features wireless charging
5,The phone is elegant and fully equipped like any other phone.
4,Love my new iPhone. The staff at Best Buy did a great job in helping me decide which phone would be best for me.
4,The new iPhone was a great upgrade from the iPhone 6. The camera is amazing!
5,This iphone replaces an iphone 4s. I love it! Only downside is the number of apps I really liked but are no longer supported.
5,Best phone ever. Best Buy is the best store ever. They have everything you need.
4,Over all the phone is good. I like the camera and it functions well
5,"Enjoying my first iPhone, now I am completely an Apple user. I was again impressed with the Best Buy staff. Great knowledge and a desire to help made this another pleasant experience."
5,Beautiful improvements on the 7. Bigger capacity makes it a great value!
5,Awesome phone Apple is great company easy to use nice upgrade
5,Iphone 8 all the way. Great buy for the buck. Best phone ever.
2,"This phone is slower, screen flickers, much heavier. I should have stayed with the 7."
5,"I love this new phone, great features I love the new camera"
5,Great phone for my needs to do my everyday things will
5,This phone is a step up from my iPhone 6 and SE. beautiful.
4,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7. Some good features compared to my last 7. Love the true tone color where it adjust the white balance base on the amount of light in your surrounding. Its quite pleasant on the eyes. Wireless charging isn't the greatest but the feature is there if needed. bigger storage is always a plus. starts at 64 as oppose to 32 in its last model. I would honestly say, if you're coming from a iPhone 6 or lower, this would be a great upgrade. If you have a 7 like I did. Should probably keep it."
4,Phone is wonderful easy to use and set up. screen is great love the fact that it is as great as plus but smaller and less bulky.
5,"This is a great phone, not too much of an upgrade from the 7."
5,Easy to use. Screen is super clear and has good sensitivity.
5,Easy to get use too. Feel like I have more security than with Android.
5,I love my new rose gold iPhone eight. It’s slim beautiful and easy to use. There are some new things to learn since I previously was an android user. I find the transition easy and lots of fun.
5,Great phone! Full charge lasts forever and overall speed is amazing. A must have!
5,I am expecting a great performance from this product. My other iPhone did not disappoint.
5,My wife’s iPhone 6 was struggling but this is a massive upgrade in every way.
5,I have been an Apple customer for several years and they never disappoint me. The new phone screen is very crisp and gorgeous. I upgraded from the IPhone 6 and love it.
5,"Avid apple user for years. Some say apples behind in technology, but I think they just perfect it before releasing!"
5,"The iphone 8 in my opinion is a very good phone but not much better than the 6 or even 7. With the exception of wireless charging, It's really not worth the extra cost."
5,"This was a replacement phone for an iphone 6. Very happy with the phone and the technician, from best buy, who transferred my data from old phone to new. Just wish they weren't as expensive as they are. So far phone works very well."
5,"Love the newest features , charging pad convince is great . Wish I could afford the X"
2,"The new iPhones are underwhelming. It’s nice that the hardware and software are a little better than previous models, but the phones are overpriced. The glass on the phone’s front and back cause it to slide off of surfaces frequently and make it difficult to hold in my hand. I prefer the metal-backed phones because the friction makes them easier to hold. I have dropped this phone many times and have already cracked the screen. Very glad I didn’t pay $1000 for the X."
4,"I was going to go with the 7, but this turned out to be a better value. The camera is much better and I’m looking forward to wireless charging."
5,This is replacing my wife’s iphone6 s. I can definitely tell the difference in speed. Much faster processor. Other than that you can’t really tell the difference. The wireless charging is cool too. I have a Lexus NX sport and it had the iq charger in it but charges slow.
5,I am very pleased with this phone and it has fufiled all of my phone needs.
1,"Dear support,
I purchased the IPhone 8 and I cannot use an European simcard. What can I do?"
4,"I upgraded From a Iphone 5 to a Iphone 8
I love the photos and slow motion video"
4,Great upgrade! Everything my old iPhone had plus more. Only reason for 4 stars was lack of the dual cameras as the iPhone 8 plus offers.
5,this phone fits my needs perfectly and the camera is fantastic
5,I'm new to iPhone. It is a great phone. A lot of features.
3,I had to get a new Phone because I dropped my old one and shattered it. I went to work and tried to plug in my headphones and found out I can’t. The NEW headphones plug into the charger so you can’t listen to music and keep your phone charged at the same time unless you charge it wireless but that type of charger is an extra cost.
5,"I know everyone is going crazy over the X, but I’m still set on having a home button."
5,Best Buy has the new iPhone in stock and make it super quick and easy to upgrade
4,"Battery life appears to be excellent, phone is lightning fast, takes excellent pictures. I haven't found anything I do not like about it. Rated 4 stars based on reviews I read that the glass back can easily be broken, not even going to take the chance so it went from the shelf into an otterbox."
5,Love it so far. I am usually the one with the oldest phone now I have the best!
5,i upgraded from 6s to the 8. haven't had any issues with the phone. works like any other iphone. the home button isnt a real button just touch sensitive which i like.
5,My daughter really likes the phone as her iPhone 6 stopped working. It is a great replacement!
5,No other phone I’ve owned has been as reliable. It just works!
5,Another top notch Apple product. Wireless charging is a must.
4,Battery life isn’t any better than the iphone6 I had
4,I am very pleased with the iphone 8. It is the best phone I ever had
5,Have always loved iPhones. They never disappoint. Good service at the cellular spot in Best Buy
5,Phone we have come to expect and need. Camera is even better than the last one. Great memory capacity.
5,Easy to use. Info easily transferred from Samsung 5 s
5,"Upgraded from an iPhone 6 to a ""regular"" iPhone 8. Thought about the X but decided instead to go with the regular 8. It's fast, reliable, and a solid performer."
5,great experience at Best Buy. Excellent phone with great features
5,Very easy to use. Great camera. Great speakers. Easy to handle.
5,Noticeably faster than my iPhone 6. Very satisfied so far!
5,"Not really new and sexy, but a good, reliable phone with incremental upgrades"
5,"Purchased the Iphone8 for my son, the sales rep was helpful and patient, price match for the iphone plus gave discounts for accessories."
5,"iPhones used to be about innovation, nowadays they are about reliability and security. That's it. Waiting for the next crazy model, since nothing else surprises me nowadays, not even the overpriced X"
4,The Iphone 8 seems to be quite similar to the Iphone 7 minus a few upgraded features. I have had many issues of glitches with the phone shutting itself off.
5,I absolutely love the new iPhone. It’s so much faster than the 5se
5,I bought this because my old phone would constantly die. The new hardware is so much better. This phone is lightning fast and this camera is amazing.
5,"Great iPhone, worth the money and very efficient and high tech"
5,"The service was great & they explained everything so i knew what i was getting into . Plus , love the phone"
4,"I am not a avid phone junkie. There are some that utilize their phones for just about everything . No judgment here just the way our society is today and to be honest I am not so much or perhaps just not as quick. I see lots of advantages from a iPhone 6 to the 8. The camera is a plus, The operating system is much more responsive and the cell reception in the north area of my city is much better as I have both of the MAIN cell services with multiple device that apple provides and do not think it has to do the service provider. All in all a great phone but a bit pricey as it comes from an old rather dapper chap ( if may add) like myself that finds himself more routinely saying, "" I remember when .... and in this case - "" I rember when I could get a cell phone for free....
hahahahah!"
5,"Great camera, holds its charge, clarity on phone calls is good."
4,Very Satisfied So Far There is a lot to learn but I am getting there
5,I am so glad I made the switch I couldn't be happier that I now have the iOS 11 on the apple 8
5,I Recommend doing the instore pickup. I was in and out of the store with a new phone in less than 15 min
5,Got my wife this new version of the iPhone. She loves it. She used to have a 6s and this is so much faster.
4,I would recommend this product for someone who is making a big jump in there phone upgrade. I would not spend money switching from iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 not worth the slight difference
5,My mother got this for herself she wasn’t to fond of the bigger screen so she got the smaller version of the 8. She has been use to the home button being a physical button so this one has the home button from the iPhone 7 which has that Taptic feedback home button. Which isn’t an actual button. Just felt really weird for her but eventually got how it works. Now it’s not an issue other than that she says it’s a nice upgrade for the iPhone if you need to upgrade and want a smaller screen.
4,I upgraded from an iphone 5 so not sure what’s “new” but do not like power button on side. It’s easier on top. I like weight and size but still learning features.
5,Love all the features on the new phone. Enjoy learning all the new things.
5,"lost the old phone, but this to replace, happy with the camera in iPhone 8,"
5,Great phone great price!!! Love all the extras with this phone
4,"I had the 6 and while this isn’t a huge step forward it’s def a marked improvement over my 6, I love the stereo speakers, improved battery, and just overall performance. I didn’t want to spend the money on the X and I’m very happy with this."
5,"It was time to upgrade my iPhone 6s which was still in great shape, so after much research I chose the iPhone 8 and I have kept my 6s for my work phone. I love my new iPhone 8. I chose the silver, which actually looks white to me, and it is beautiful. I love the feel of the phone and the camera is fabulous. Win win for me!"
5,"Excellent product! Works as advertised, love the color!"
5,Phone is easy to use. Camera is very good. Processor is fast as well.
5,I'm happy with the purchase. Just what I was expecting.
5,Very happy with this phone. Went from the 5 to the 8 and it is a vast improvement.
3,"Really like the 6s, besides better camera. Should’ve waited for X"
5,Daughter loves her new iPhone. Camera is much better and more space
5,Until you have the extra power you don’t know what you’re missing. In today’s phone usage we spend time on Social Media and News/sports sites so the clarity of sound and picture are great! BATTERY LIFE will knock your socks off... Best phone yet
4,Had problems with the phone not locking at first even though I had auto lock on. After I updated it to the current version I haven’t noticed this problem now.
5,"Very responsive and easy to utilize. Love the new features from the upgraded iOS operating system. Especially the increase in battery life, do not have to utilize the external battery as was needed with the iPhone 6. Fully recommend for others wanting a new iPhone without spending an extremely high price. Let the iPhone X work out the kinks before switching."
5,A little pricey but worth it. Loving it. Would recommend it to a friend
5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6. Love the new features.
5,It was working good anything looking great and camera working good
5,"Really happy with my brand new iphone 8. I've had an iphone 6 for several years and the touchscreen has been less responsive over time, so my new iphone is a vast improvement as the touch screen is very responsive! Also, the display clarity, set-up, siri, camera, etc... are all new and improved. LOVE IT!!!"
5,"Good camera, great battery life. Another happy iPhone user."
5,Very satisfied with the speed and battery life. Highly recommend.
4,I purchased the phone a couple weeks ago and it has worked great. Very easy to figure out and has an awesome camera. Battery life is good as well.
5,My wife loves the phone. Have been waiting since the 6. Better in every way
5,Love the phone. Better in every possible way. Buy one.
5,Have been a apple fan for years. Went from a 6 to an 8. It's faster but I'm still getting used to the multi touch.
4,"Love this phone, the size is perfect and the camera is amazing!"
4,I bought this for my son. He seems to really like it.
5,I really like this phone. It replaced an iPhone 6 and works great. Fast processor and really good camera. Easy to setup.
5,"Love my iPhone 8!! Upgraded from 6 so well worth the upgrade! Love the camera, wireless charging and speed!"
4,"Really not huge changes from the 6 to the 8s IPhone. Yes, size matters, but I wouldn’t have purchased a new phone if the 6 didn’t have some malfunctioning. Just TOO expensive!"
4,This iPhone is a little faster than the 6s I had. Also the battery lasts longer. Otherwise it is pretty much the same.
5,Excellent feature and much better than my 6s I phone
5,Apple again has made great improvements. Never failed to impress
4,iPhone 8 has a new feel but it's very fast. I think I'm going to like it when I figure out how to plug headphones in.
5,"Just the right size, easy to use, nice upgrade.This phone is what I was looking for."
5,"The battery life on this phone is great. I can go the day without charging the phone, and that’s with heavy use."
5,I needed a new phone badly.. And this phone works great..
5,My experience buying and now using th new iPhone 8 has been nothing short of fantastic. This phone is 64 gig. The hey Siri feature is amazingly convenient. The advanced camera is a lot more fun to play with.
5,"This version of the Iphone is great! While it is bumming that the home button is not a button anymore, the camera can take excellent quality photos and the operating system is fast and reliable."
5,"I can't wait to set it up, it seems like a really big improvement!"
5,Was going to gt a 7 but the price difference for the added features made the upgrade worthwhile. Still need to get to the Apple Store for learn about the newer features
4,Great product. Excellent upgrad from I phone 6. Great Camera
5,We always buy Apple phones and the wife loves this phone.
5,"Had the iPhone 6 so this is a big step up, but it’s amazing the features that this phone brings"
5,For the price It was worth it. I upgraded from 6 plus. If you have the 7 it isn’t worth upgrading to the 8. IOS 11 is beautiful.
5,Owned a IPhone 6 (kept it as a backup) and purchased the 8 straight up. On the surface they look quite similar but don’t let that fool you. The thing is wickedly fast. I simply didn’t care about the X coming out. Spending a grand on a phone is the end of the line for me. Get it if you have a 6 or older. You’ll be happy. No problems at all.
5,Great to deal with walked in to the mobile store and 20 minutes later walked out with a new phone. Didn’t have to make an appointment like other places at the mall.
5,I bought an iPhone 8plus and after a few days returned it for an Iphone8. The Plus was too big and the 8 is perfect
5,"Prons,
Big screen
No freezing
Camera resolution
4G LTE

Cons:
Slippery surface. Need cover
Medium antenna"
5,Upgraded my dads phone because his old phone was goin out
4,"Great phone and works much better than my 5s, a little disappointed on the camera though. Thought it had more options and updates, I probably should’ve read more reviews. Possibly would’ve gotten the plus just for the added camera benefits."
5,So far so good. It has features that are very useful.
5,"Didn’t regret my purchase, loving my new phone. Best Buy"
5,Love my new iPhone! No cracks like my old 6 and the battery lasts all day.
5,I love the thin sleek design and the sound and picture quality.
4,Purchased for family member phone seems the same but was told processor is a bit quicker
5,"Easy to use & program, goodbattery life,superb camera & screen resolution."
5,Bought these for my teen daughter’s. They’re solid phones.
4,"Nice upgrade from an iphone 5S. Faster processor, better camera, more memory all are improvements. Initial cell data reception issues seem to be resolved with the last OIS update. Needed a new phone immediately so could not wait for the X. This phone is solid but not revolutionary."
4,Phone is Great. Battery life is best I’ve seen from and iPhone yet. Also the glass seems to be stronger. Time will tell. Love they want back to there original black shade.
5,Love the camera. The space on the phone is excellent. Should have all phones start with 64 gigabytes.
4,"This phone is a nice upgrade from the Apple iPhone 5s. You have to use an adapter for headphones if you want to use your own wired headphones, which is a bit annoying at first."
4,"This phone was well worth the wait. The color is perfect, the camera takes phenomenal pictures, and the size is just right."
5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6. The speed of the processor on this phone is definitely noticeable. I didn’t think I would notice a difference but I do. I’m so happy that I did not wait upgrade!
5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6. The speed of the processor on this phone is definitely noticeable. I didn’t think I would notice a difference but I do. I’m so happy that I did not wait upgrade!
5,Love the phone and color it’s just great! The processing system is so fast!
5,The iphoneb8 plus is a great phone. The phone itself is sleeker and much faster than the 6 I previously owned.
5,It is a nice phone. It has a great camera. I like it.
5,It is a nice phone. The camera is great. I like it.
4,"Great phone, but then again it is a iphone so that is expected. Love the waterproof feature, but wish it had an audio jack."
3,"I would not bother with upgrading if you have an iPhone 6s or better. My battery on my 6s was not lasting as long as I would like so I decided to upgrade. Don’t feel like anything earth shattering came of it, and in hindsight it would probably have been better to just replace the battery on my 6s. Having said that there is nothing wrong with this phone, but it was an expensive purchase for not that much more utility. It does fee nicer to hold though"
5,I love how easy it was to transfer my data. Just as easy to use as my iPhone 6.
4,If you like no control and be protected from everything then get an iPhone.
5,"Excelent, i had the old iphone 5 and this is such a great upgrade"
5,Get service from the seller. I was very superpleased
5,Easy to use good replacement for my iPhone 6. camera awesome
5,"Great phone for regular people, easy to use UI. All tech enthusiasts should get the X instead."
5,I love this upgrade iphone 8 and love the color too
5,"Best phone ever...I am so glad I waited, skipped the 7 and love my iPhone 8"
4,So far so good. Camera is the best thing about the new iPhone. If you take a lot of pics you'll notice a significant difference.
5,I had had apple products in the past and decided to try a Samsung S8 plus it was a nice phone but I never got used to the andriod OS upgraded to the iPhone 8 and love it.
4,Love the size of my iPhone. Love the capabilities.
4,"I-phone 8 is up to the task. A little pricey, but an attractive and solid device, with very good battery response. I like then size and the screen resolution is great. Design change for headphones was unnecessary, but at least they give you an adapter."
2,phone very seldom used.Battery won't hold a charge
5,Love this phone. So far so good. Nice upgrade from the IPhone 6 that I was using.
5,I continue to buy in this store everything necessary for me and my children because I always feel very well attended by its employees and all its staff the products that I buy are of very good quality thanks for listening to me
5,Great phone but not much difference from the iphone 7
5,The biggest change from the 7 is the wireless charging
4,"No new bells and whistles in terms of function, but the processor works great."
4,We love the iPhone 8....good size memory for price
5,"Simple upgrades on the 7, as opposed to the more innovative X, this is a nice, familiar package with significant speed upgrades"
4,"Wanted to upgrade from 6s and this is nice option, standard apple features, could have waited for 10"
5,I had to pick between the 8 and the X. The money per month was negligible. I am still a fan of the classic iPhone design.
5,"Made my return to iPhone after a 4 year break. The previous discount provider was ok, but android can’t meet iPhone quality. The 8 is smooth, sleek, and easy to transition for me. Great product."
4,"I love my new iPhone 8. The camera is fabulous. I still dont like the button that isnt a button anymore, but other than that its a great phone."
5,Amazing phone! The upgrade was much worth it! Excellent!
5,I really like how the phone looks and works really great!
5,I really like this new phone! I would recommend it to anyone
5,Great for a replacement for my iPhone 5s. Very responsive.
5,"The product is as described. I am still a preferred android user, this was a gift for my sister."
5,"Huge upgrade from my old i phone! Bigger screen, better camera good size."
5,"Siri has really stepped her game up. It's like having Alexa in your pocket, plus a great camera, etc."
5,Great phone I love it .. although I hate the lighting adapter for headphones
5,Great phone! Too many options to mention. Great battery life. Camera is crazy good!
5,Upgraded from the iPhone 6 and notice a big difference.
5,I love the upgrade to my phone and the new features
5,My son loves this new phone. The camera is awesome and the convenience of the charging pad is great.
5,"If you have an iPhone 6 or earlier, this is a worthy upgrade. Battery life is noticeably faster than my iPhone 6. There's a bit of a learning curve getting used to the new ""Home"" button, but it's worth the upgrade if you're eligible for it."
5,"I have always been an iPhone, or Apple user. My wife and I both have iPhones, we both have MacBooks, and everything just syncs and works together great. Now I’ve always been the plus size user but I decided to get the regular iPhone this time and not much different but getting use to the screen. Resolution is on point. Pictures are great. Wireless charging is the best function I have found so far. I am a neat and organized person, I am that person that has a spot for his keys, wallet, wedding ring, and phone. Now I’ve got my wireless charger next to my box that holds all my other stuff and it’s great. Don’t have to worry about plugs or anything when you leave, especially when you are in a hurry. Great phone."
5,What is there to say...it’s an iPhone. Wouldn’t purchase any other brang
5,Daughter says it is working above par versus her iphone 6 for which she replaced it with!
5,"Everything I read about the 8 is amazing. I just came from a 6 and my experience is a day to night difference. It’s clearer, sharper, faster, and just flows. I don’t have the plus for the portrait feature but I still love my pictures. They’re really crisp. Don’t know if this feature is new to 8 but on photo mode you can change the color mode before taking the pictures that’s interesting. There’s a free app I found for creative editing that starts with Pris and that’s real fun. My phone is beautiful I love looking at it. It’s silver it’s so pretty I had to find a nice clear case so I can admire it. Got it on opening day and I have nothing to complain about."
5,awesome phone does everything it says it does plus new glass back looks sick
5,Great looking phone. Nice camera. Works faster than my iphone 6 plus. Very Happy.
5,Easier to use. Updates happen faster. Lighter. Thinner.
5,Loving my new iPhone 8! Super fast compared to my old iPhone 6
5,"My biggest complaint about the 7 was the battery life. No more complaining, the 8 is awesome. Charges quick and doesnt drain immediately!"
5,Have been waiting for this product to get on market. Gift was well received.
5,It is very easy to use and I would highly recommend it to anyone
5,Nice looking phone. Great camera. Home button is a little stiff.
5,Upgrade from a 6 and the differences are few but improved and best thing same home charger and car charger just needed to change case because of camera but that is no biggie!
5,"I have had 3 iPhones and love the way they just work. I know many of the Android phones compete and maybe even have more features. I have thought about switching at times. The thing that keeps me coming back is incremental improvements to a great phone that works. The breadth of the app store is incomparable. The iPhone 8 isn't much different from the previous generation, but it does seem to be a lot faster. It has good battery life. I miss the headphone jack but am finding ways to work around the change."
5,"You can't go wrong with an iPhone and the iPhone 8 is awesome! Nice size, super fast."
4,"Bought for my wife to replace her iPhone 6. It was a great replacement. Only minor concern (that seems to be a know issue and being addressed) is there seems to be a crackling sound coming from ear speaker when making phone calls. Thought I saw an update to “fix” the issue, but didn’t seem to work for ours on 11.0.2"
4,"My wife love it, she has plenty of storage for her pictures. Seems lighter than the other iPhone we had, just slight larger."
4,"Easy to use, more apps than necssary for a Senior Citizen. Easy to use and read as stated, plenty of storage."
5,I had no learning curve to go through. I upgraded from my IPHONE 6 and was pleasantly surprised at how user friendly it is.
4,"This is a great option over the iPhone X, on paper it will be just as fast with a smaller and lower resolution screen and a lower price point. It feels great to hold and familiar which I don't mind. I would not upgrade if you have a 7, but if you are coming from a 6 it is worth it."
5,I used to use samsung and then i switched to Apple. I have had apple for the last 5 years. I will never go back to Samsung
5,I would recommend the iPhone 8 for all age groups. It is large enough to see easily but not too large for my pocket. It is like having a computer in my pocket!
5,My new iPhone 8 is larger than my iPhone 5s but not too large for my pocket. It is easier to read and has many functions that I use!
5,I just recent my bought the iPhone 8 and I’m in Love with it !
5,Easy to transition from an i6 to the i8. We love the camera.
5,Great phone as always from Apple. Camera is excellent!!
5,The camera is phenomenal and the phone's processor is snappy. The augmented reality applications are sharp. IOS 11 has not disappointed.
5,I am happy with my iPhone 8 and the service I got.
5,"Finally talked my parents into upgrading, the process went smoothly at the store and restoring from their old phones went better than expected."
5,"Great phone, love it, best phone ever! Perfect size, color, cameras great"
5,Like the iPhone 8 not the plus. Has lot of good features. One that is really great is you can now type with one hand.
4,"Apple is overrated, too expensive for most folks. I do like the keyboard"
5,Great Screen. Great Camera. The phone is very fast and smooth.
5,"The iPhone 8 is the most comfortable device yet. Very efficient operations.
It appears that all around apps Transferring was very smooth. Highly recommended"
4,"Just needed to upgrade, old phone was about to give out. I dont see TOO many new features."
5,"Even though there aren’t many differences from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8, this phone is faster. I am very happy with my purchase."
5,"Replaced my broken iPhone 6s with an iPhone 8. Fast, great display, most of the technology of the iPhone X, $300 less and available now."
5,2017’s iPhone 8 is a Premium feel and great screen resolution
5,iPhone 8 Need a new phone my old iPhone 6 dided today so I went too replace it
3,"was so disappointed in the battery life. i've shut off all that's not necessary or i don't use and yet the battery doesn't last long. i need to keep it in low battery mode and i put it in airplane mode when not using it. my old iPhone 5 had a better battery. the only thing better than my old phone is the camera but it's not like i'm taking professional pictures that i needed a better camera. by this time, apple should have a fantastic product. AND, the phone has only been out ONE week and ALREADY THEY HAVE AN UPDATE. Very disappointed in this phone that is that expensive!"
5,"My son always had iPhone but was given an android phone last year. He wasn't happy with it and switched back to Apple. Great decision, iPhone 8 is way better than anticipated."
5,"Love my new phone, works great this is my 3rd Apple phone"
5,The iPhone 8 has the feel of my 6s yet the features are “upgraded”...lI’ve my new camera niecmy pics are more “crisp”
5,I am loving it. You will too. This has been a awesome upgrade for me.
4,I love the sleekness of the phone and it’s many upgraded apps.
5,"The phone feels and behaves a lot like the 7 (battery, size, etc) but the glass back gives it a nice look. A pretty solid phone all in all if you want to retain the touch ID sensor."
4,"It was fine, but I was not happy that I chose 64GB (stupidly!). My fault, so giving it 4 stars since it couldn't help that it had tiny storage."
5,What’s there to say about the phone it’s the same scenario every year. But still worth the upgrade.
5,I bought this phone because my phone stopped working and it been ok since i bought it
5,I upgraded to iphone8— I will upgrade to plus next time.
5,I had been thinking of getting a new phone as my old one kept crashing. Good choice on my part.
5,Good phone for doing everything that I need to dos
4,"Love the phone. Glad they included the wired headphones as I didn't want to drop another wad of cash for the BT earbuds. In the US, 95% of phones are iPhones; globally 95% are Android. Being in the US with an iPhone is just good common sense (price not considered!). Didn't wait for the X, as I'm just not going to jump that hurdle of a grand for a portable, breakable, easy to lose device."
3,I was excited to buy new iPhone 8 and it was a quick purchase.
5,Bought the iPhone 8 for my kids. No complaints so far and jealous that they now have a better phone than I do.
5,Works great amazing camera nice clean screen very happy
5,"From my iPhone 6, It is great improve. Good response and high performance camera."
5,"The only thing better than an iPhone, is an iPhone."
4,"same good old iPhone, nice and slick, felt really nice in hands and seems like having fast chip works well."
3,"I owned a Apple 5, had trouble with it, I AM EVER SO SORRY I BOUGHT THE 8, battery doesn't hold a charge, contacts touch a letter and it brings up who ever very poor!!"
3,"I purchased a new iPhone 8, unlocked, for a friend. No hassles EXCEPT, when I was asked if I wished a receipt to be sent via email, NONE WAS SENT. In order to be sure I had proof of purchase with AppleCare, I had to return to the store and ask for it to be physically printed. This is not good service. Why is it not possible to access my account, digitally, gain access to the receipt, and print it at home instead of spending time and expense driving?
The phone, by the way, is, as usual, GREAT!"
4,It works. I can make calls on it. I can look up stuff on the ol inter web. Thumbs up!
4,"Probably not worth it if you're upgrading from an iPhone 7, but if you're doing the Verizon payment plan, why not, right?

Upgrades are:

- Faster processor
- Wireless charging (this method charges very slowly; only beneficial overnight)
- (I think) faster cable charging. I can usually get 80% battery life in about an hour.
- Slightly better camera

That's really it. I upgraded from that iPhone SE, and that seemed very fast (it ran the same processor as a 6S). I mean honestly, at a certain point faster processors won't matter.

The glass back is very pretty, but the outer rim is still aluminum so it is very prone to dents. 

Everyone is waiting for the iPhone X anyway... haha."
5,IiPhone 8 has glass screen and glass back. I have the slate grey and the color is really closer to black. Very nice to hold ant the wireless charging is very handy. Vibrant screen color and blazing fast phone!!
5,Traded my son's iPhone 6 for the Iphone 8. Battery last much longer. Everything runs smoother and faster. Another happy purchase from Best buy!
4,"Upgrading from the iPhone six will not immediately jump out as a huge change. But the added response of the processor made it well worth it. I would not pay full price, but with the buy one get the second free deal, it was a steal at 400."
5,"Solid phone, and a huge upgrade from the iPhone 6 I was using before!"
4,This is the phone for people in the apple ecosystem that like a good clicking home button and don’t want to upgrade to the buttonless iPhone X.
5,I haven’t had an iPhone since my 4s I decided to switch to Samsung now back to iPhone I love it battery life is fantastic I use it listening to music about 6 hrs at work and after an 8 hr shift I have 85% battery life still I charge the phone every other day it’s kool not having to worry if the phone will run out of battery
5,This was my first iPhone. Previously I always had android. I am extremely pleased with the iPhone security and its functionality. I’m busy learning the new changes and enjoying it.
5,"I love the iPhones. I upgraded from a iPhone 6 to an 8. This phone is a vast improvement in performance than the iPhone 6, the touch ID is incredibly fast."
5,"I replaced my iphone 6 with the iphone 8 and I enjoy this phone. I didn't have many issues with the iphone 6, so it was an easy choice to upgrade."
5,"This phone has an outstanding camera, especially compared to my previous iPhone 5. Also, just as important to me is the outstanding sound quality when I play music."
5,Glad its basically same size as my iphone 6s was and operating system was a lil different but useful and i adapted quickly
5,"I traded in my iPhone 6 for this iPhone 8, great features!"
5,I had an iPhone 5s for the last 3.5 years or so and finally upgraded with the new overhaul of the iOS. I went from 16 gb phone to 256 gb. It’s amazing! And though it’s physically bigger than my last phone it’s not too big for my little hands which is a relief.
5,Love the Rose Gold. Slim phone. Have a lot of memory. Worth it!
2,"You used to have to use passcode to turn off an iPhone. Great for find phone as thief could not turn it off until they find a spot with no signal to try and break into it. Even with parental settings it can just be turned off. 

The location settings seem to be a hit and miss lately also. Ours says we are logging in from Texas which is thousands of miles from home

As far as the camera and speed and apps it’s amazing. Apple is still our phone of choice"
5,Very Good Phone. Step up from the 7. Speed is great.
5,Powerful apps and great pictures. Upgraded from Iphone 6 and am impressed with speed and memory.
5,No complaints with the phone. It is an iphone. Much better battery life than the 6s.
5,This device builds on the excellent job Apple did with the iPhone 7. I have not had any issues with it thus far.
5,The iPhone 8 is great wish it wasn’t all glass but it does look good
5,The iPhone 8 is great wish it wasn’t all glass but it does look good
5,Went from a 6 to the 8 and there's a fairly good difference in performance. The upgrade was simple and all it required was an IOS upgrade and a restore from backup to be up and running in less than an hour. Even auto-paired to my watch.
5,"So far loving this phone, upgraded from the 5s. This is a great upgrade and I thought the size would be annoying but it isn't bad at all."
4,"When I text, I’m finding that whole sentences appear without my pressing the letters.
I do like the clarity of the camera."
2,"I thought this would have new features compared to the iphone 7. I was disappointed it did not and decided instead to go to the iphone X, once I saw a demo of it. 

Anyone looking to upgrade might as well save money and buy an iphone 7 (or even an iphone 6) or skip the iphone 8 and go directly to the iphone X."
5,Super responsive iPhone. Love the shade of gold...so classy!
5,Nothing better than not running out of memory! Super fast and camera is great.
5,This phone is fast! Battery is great and overall just what I needed. Glad I upgraded from my 6.
5,"Worth every penny. I use my phone for everything, so it’s great to have one with a ton of room and works great"
4,I enjoy the intuitive interface of iPhones. Only upgraded because iOS 11 wrecked my iPhone 6. Will go to 12 on the 8 but no further. Apple makes great stuff but the iOS updates should be tested more on older iPhones and the iOS should not be distributed to older models with bugs.
5,"We went from the 5s to the 8 and we love it. So much space, works great love the Screen. It is bigger than our other phone but I really to love it and it’s not so big that it’s awkward."
5,This phone is great. Everything about it is an improvement over 6+. Pictures are much better. I also like the smaller size. Couldn’t be happier!
5,It’s a iPhone 8 love it. Didnt realize it was glass on front and back. Fourth iPhone I have owned.
5,"I love my iPhone, I'm a loyal customer. And the eight is such a fantastic upgrade! I especially appreciate the improvement in the camera. Such a difference!"
4,It’s your basic iPhone. I’m loving the enhanced clairity of the pictures.
5,"Very pleased with my iPhone 8, although I would have liked a bit more of cut in price, considering that the X is now out."
4,"I had the iPhone 6 so this is def a good upgrade. Just a few glitches like the way it auto corrects the letter I to I️. Also has a prompt that continues to come up saying the product I’m trying to order is not available. I’m not ordering anything. 
Like the camera clarity and some other features but I️ miss the headphone jack."
5,Absolutely my favorite thing is the wireless charging. No more bending cords. Camera is great also
5,I love my iPhone 8 because it is just the right size and does everything I need to do.
5,Only been a month but so far no complaints and I’m loving it.
5,"Does everything that I need (calls, texts, internet and camera)."
5,"Upgrade from iPhone 6, so of course it feels faster, but it is very quick with all functions currently."
4,"I purchased about a month ago and have been using this every day since for business and personal use. The speed is dramatically better than prior iPhones and I like the solid feel of the new case material. The display, camera and photo quality is noticeably better. Overall a worthwhile upgrade."
4,iPhone continues to be the alpha of phones. Will take some getting used to from earlier models.
4,I have noticed since Steve Jobs passed away that things aren’t as tight as they used to be under him and Apple. But still overall a very good product
5,Great battery life. It operates well and works a lot faster than the 5
5,"Got the iPhone 8 for my daughter, she loves her phone. No complaints so far."
5,This is the best phone I have owned. It has so many features that my other phones didn’t have
4,Not as special as everyone says but still a great apple product. Feels to be the same as he 6 and 7
5,This phone is amazing. The camera and photo quality is amazing especially having upgraded from iPhone 5s.
3,Had some problems connecting my phone and making my iMessages work. Finally worked after a week!
5,Better speed than previous models: Extremely good picture quality:
4,"I️ love the iPhone 8. I️ upgraded from the iPhone6 and I️ love the new features, the storage and the camera."
5,Upgraded my wife's phone from a 6 to the 8. Subtle differences. Phone works as advertised. Takes great pictures!
4,My Iphone 6 had a sprung case so I upgraded to iphone 8 256GB... Itunes as usual was confusing and I was unable to use it to transfer to new phone... I did get everything on it... enjoy the new phone as usual the OS updates add more function to the phone so I do consider this a improvement. No 5 stars yet until I can off load all data and files via USB drive.
5,Great products. Customer service very nice and helpful.
5,"Nice step forward for the IPhone, we didn’t buy the iPhone X because it wasn’t a big enough step forward. Maybe the iPhone 11, because the screen is awesome."
5,"What can I say about Apple IPhone, it's a very good Brand and love all the features, great iPhone so far ,haven't used much but really, it's Very good Phone."
5,This is a very solid iPhone. The battery is awesome. I am enjoying the freedom of not always having to be near a charging device!
5,Apple makes the best phones highly recommended these are great
5,"Love the new phone, hate the new IOS, but the phone is great, camera is awesome"
5,"Love the new phone, hate the new IOS, but the phone is great, camera is awesome"
5,"I love this phone, especially the camera. Huge difference from my iPhone 6."
4,"I bought this phone about a month ago, but it has been solid so far. Easy to use. The only thing a little tough to get used to is that the home button doesn’t actually press in. You just touch it essentially."
5,Awesome phone. Definitely a must have love all the new features
5,Typical apple product. Well built and easy to use.
5,"I had been using my iPhone 4S since it was released and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. I’m totally amazed with the better reception, camera and speed of this phone."
5,This was an excellent purchase and I would suggest this phone for anyone!
5,"Even though I know the iPhone X was coming out in the near future, I decided to go with the iPhone 8 instead. It wasn't a decision on whether or not I could afford it, but how much of the features that the X has that I would actually use that would justify paying extra for. Not to mention, I do prefer the home button that I have been used to since the first iPhone ever came out. And I like the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone. I would recommend it to anyone with a 6s or older model. You really aren't getting much more than what you have with the 7. The iPhone 8 doesn't look much different since it's last major redesign from the iPhone 6, but it definitely has the improvements in technology on the inside to make it a worthy investment. My best advice when it comes to choosing any phone is to go with what you prefer in a phone. That made my decision a lot easier and the iPhone 8 is perfect for me."
5,works very good and fast. I'm pleased with tyhis phone so far.
5,"Great phone, fast processing, stunning picture quality, perfect size for hand held use."
5,I like the new slimmer and somewhat smaller design! It's an Iphone and it is therefore great!
2,"Nothing special. Only reason I bought it because the Watch 3 is not functional with iPhone 5S. Wake up Apple. Minor tweaks on hardware and the same old linked, but not integrated business apps from 2010 are unimaginative."
5,My wife upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this 8. She has been really pleased with the performance.
5,So I bought this phone for my gf bc she had a 6 with hardely any memory. She sees no difference and shes happy so its a 5 star for me lol
5,"I currently have an iPhone 7 and I decided to upgrade to the 8. So far, I am really happy with the phone."
5,It is the perfect fit for my wife. She needn’t worry about memory or taking pictures or text messages. There is room for it all.
4,Phone works great especially if you are an iPhone person. Apple doesn’t work with Google assistant that well and not all of your contacts info will come from an android. I have no complaints.
5,"So far I like the phone, very fast and takes great pictures"
5,"Hard to tell photos apart from my Cannon Rebel. Great noticeable display. 256 Gigs......... need I say more??? Great phone, I didnt think they would out do the others but they did."
5,"Needed to upgrade from my 64 GB iPhone 6 to this 256 GB iPhone 8. Not many changes but it is definitely faster with the iOS upgrade and can handle my mail, contacts, calendar and pics/videos. Good buy!"
5,"Upgrading from an iPhone 5s to the iPhone 8 was a huge jump. It's much faster, takes better pictures and has a better finger print sensor. The new OS seems better too."
5,Great buy! Super fast! Blew the competition out of the water!
3,"Apple has made changes that are counter intuitive and not very smart. I don't like that. Even though it was backed up from my old iphone, the backup froze and geek squad had no idea why. All of my photos and all of my music has disappeared and on line directions to fix it on itunes seem to be useless for the new phone that I bought."
5,The 8 is everything you've come to expect for an iPhone. Upgraded from a 6 because of the wireless charging and the waterproofing and I'm super glad I did. Another good iPhone evolution.
5,"much quicker, faster, brighter, awesome camera, really like it."
5,So awesome 256gb you can’t go wrong I bought it for myself and my wife very great product
5,LOVE it! It has everything I need and everything I want. I got the one with a ton of storage too
5,I love this phone I love the wireless charging in the new glass back I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to think about buying it the best upgrade I have ever made
5,"I’m a iPhone lover for life, and the upgrade from my 6s to the 8 works great!"
5,It’s like holding a 13” MacBook Pro in my hand.. super fast!
5,Like all the iPhones before it's great. I would recommend to even my enemies.
5,"The usual Apple quality, with wireless charging ! Like to use the charging pad !"
4,Replaced the 6 with this. Added features and screen are nice. Definitely and upgrade. My reason for not 5 stars is the price. >$800 for a phone??? Would never believed I pay that much.
5,"I've been hesistent on upgrading from my 5S due to the size of the 8. However, after 4 years of owning the 5S - the 8 is great upgrade. The memory from a limited 16GB to a 256 GB and the process speed is a huge improvement. I don't know about the 6, 6S or 7 but I'm fairly happy with the 8. Here's to another 4 years!"
5,"Looks are the same for the previous one, but the 8 is more faster love my iphone 8."
5,The best part is the added storage and the quality of the camera.
5,The phone is great. Strong and made well. Great Apple product as usual.
5,"The Iphone 8 is a upgrade from the Iphone 7, this phone was easy to set up and transfer from teh previous version with many more features."
5,Bought this instead of the new X This phone is fast and super easy to use. Plenty of storage
4,but I do not see any clear difference between the iPhone8 or its predecessors. Save your money and get the iPhone 6 or 7 instead.
4,Phone is Great. Battery life is best I’ve seen from and iPhone yet. Also the glass seems to be stronger. Time will tell.
5,This is an awesome phone. I would highly recommend it!
5,"Great help, great product, love Best Buy, I never leave unhappy"
5,I liked the phone but decided an 8 Plus was a better fit for me. I like the bigger screen! I never thought I would like the bigger screen but I do! The 8 doesn’t have the advanced camera.
4,Very fast compared to iPhone 6s that we replaced; great memory capacity - don't need to worry about photos taking up all of the memory.
5,My iphone6 had a terrible battery life Love how my new phone lasts all day long without needing to be recharged.
5,Always have been an iPhone fan. This phone replaced my 5s
5,No matter what the Android owners that I know say about the IPhone they just don't get it. Apple products just work well with each other not like the other Phones that are out there.
5,My 2nd i phone i upgraded from the 6s. Great speed and battery life is way way better. I can almost go a day and a half without needing to be charged. Camera is also a def upgrade. Im very happy with the 8
4,Bestbuy transfered contents of Samsung phone to new iPhone.
4,"I have always loved my iPhones, this is my 4th and they just keep getting better! Picture quality is great, no crashing, everything is running smoothly!"
3,"There are several bugs in this new release of the iPhone 8 such as static when dialing the phone, low volume levels as well as difficulties entering pass codes to numbers dialed. Some applications transferred from the iPhone 5 are difficult to open. The phone has a faster processor which is a big plus."
4,Wish there would have been better instructions on setup included. Several things I would have done differently if I had really understood what I was selecting/doing.
5,He has had them in the past and is overjoyed.Being blind this is the only phone that navigates and fills his needs.
5,We have had nothing but Iphones over the years and this is the best Iphone they have put out.
5,I had the iPhone 6s Plus before. Wanted something smaller. The phone is great. Tried the note 8. It just too used to iOS. Love this one.
5,The new iPhone works as well as the others and is a good successor to the previous model.
4,"I love my new iPhone 8 its great, awesome features, battery lasts all day and lots of storage!!"
5,I upgraded from a 6S to 8 and am very happy with the migration. The battery in my 6S was failing and I could not wait for the X. The reviews of the 8 were positive so I decided to go ahead and buy the 8 and consider the XI after all the kinks had been worked out of the new technologies in the X.
5,The iPhone 8 is the best iPhone yet. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Got this for a friend and she loves The price is a little high but worth it to make a friend happy
5,Fast and nice smartphone. Took a while to download all my iCloud files. Liked buying at BestBuy better than at Apple.
5,The phone has been great. The extra memory has been good because I take a lot of pictures and the camera is probably the best camera in a phone.
5,"I bought this as a gift for my son. He is very happy with all operations of phone. He also has Apple watch , and the phone increase the usage of the watch."
5,"Upgraded from a 5S, super fast chip! Night and day!!"
5,Huge difference from an iPhone 6. Very much worth the price.
4,"I've owned a lot of iPhones. Having some glitches with this iPhone 8. Gonna give it a few days, maybe need to exchange. Maybe a faulty device. Freezing, horrible front facing camera picture."
4,"Not particularly innovative, but a very nice upgrade from Apple. Very quick. Good battery life."
5,It was fast and great employee I would continue to buy more stuff online
5,you shouldnt need my review. you should know what to expect from apple products.
5,It is much faster than the 7 with a great color display
5,I love the phone. I upgraded from the 6s and wanted to stay with a familiar design. The phone is extremely fast when completing tasks.
4,Great phone and long lasting battery with good camera
5,"Phone works great. Features are different than previous phones (I had a really old one), but I got used to it quickly."
5,"The iPhone 8 is a blend of old-school and new-school feel and design. You'll find many of the same features from the iPhone 4, 5 and 6 built in this model. What stands out to me is the progression of the technology and the need to access information more accurately. The iPhone achieves this goal. A++ overall."

5,"The iPhone 8 is an amazing upgrade from my old iPhone 6. I loved the form factor of the 6 so I’m very happy that the 8 is almost identical in this regard. 

The TouchID is a LOT better than it was on the 6. It unlocks almost instantly, and it recognizes my fingerprint much more often then my 6 has been."
4,I went from the galaxy to the iPhone back to galaxy and now iPhone again! To be honest it’s just like the iPhone 5 I had! Galaxy was just a tad bit expensive for me this go around

4,Still familiarizing myself with the new features. No complaints so far.
4,"I went for the IPhone SE to this one. I have no complaints. Is it much better than the SE? No, but it has much more room given I had the 16gb SE, and I really loved my SE. The 8 has been pretty reliable so far, and it does have a few features my SE did not have."
4,I had an iPhone 6s when I upgraded to the 8. I’m really loving the new home button and the True Tone display.
5,"iPhone does not fail to amaze. Camera quality is a big bonus from the 6s, holds a lot more storage, and is quite effecient."

4,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7. Some good features compared to my last 7. Love the true tone color where it adjust the white balance base on the amount of light in your surrounding. Its quite pleasant on the eyes. Wireless charging isn't the greatest but the feature is there if needed. bigger storage is always a plus. starts at 64 as oppose to 32 in its last model. I would honestly say, if you're coming from a iPhone 6 or lower, this would be a great upgrade. If you have a 7 like I did. Should probably keep it."
5,I love my new rose gold iPhone eight. It’s slim beautiful and easy to use. There are some new things to learn since I previously was an android user. I find the transition easy and lots of fun.

Also, the display clarity, set-up, siri, camera, etc... are all new and improved. LOVE IT!!!"
5,I’m an iPhone member for life it’s beautiful light weight easy to used and great features have been added I love the pictures this is the only way to go!! I love you Apple!! :-)

4,This iPhone is a little faster than the 6s I had. Also the battery lasts longer. Otherwise it is pretty much the same.

5,"I can't wait to set it up, it seems like a really big improvement!"
5,For the price It was worth it. I upgraded from 6 plus. If you have the 7 it isn’t worth upgrading to the 8. IOS 11 is beautiful.
4,"I have had several IPhones - while you are kind of stuck with IPhone or Other, the IPhones are a good product!"

5,Owned a IPhone 6 (kept it as a backup) and purchased the 8 straight up. On the surface they look quite similar but don’t let that fool you. The thing is wickedly fast. I simply didn’t care about the X coming out. Spending a grand on a phone is the end of the line for me. Get it if you have a 6 or older. You’ll be happy. No problems at all.
4,"Great phone, not much different than the last, love the features and functions. Wish the prices weren't so high."
5,Great to deal with walked in to the mobile store and 20 minutes later walked out with a new phone. Didn’t have to make an appointment like other places at the mall.

5,I totally love this phone. It is so user friendly. It takes wonderful pictures.

5,Has better speakers then the seven and is good for watching videos. Easy to transition from other generations and has a better battery life.
4,Had the iPhone 6S and skipped the 7 update. So the 8 is a nice update from the 6S without breaking bank.
5,"Everything I read about the 8 is amazing. I just came from a 6 and my experience is a day to night difference. It’s clearer, sharper, faster, and just flows. I don’t have the plus for the portrait feature but I still love my pictures. They’re really crisp. Don’t know if this feature is new to 8 but on photo mode you can change the color mode before taking the pictures that’s interesting. There’s a free app I found for creative editing that starts with Pris and that’s real fun. My phone is beautiful I love looking at it. It’s silver it’s so pretty I had to find a nice clear case so I can admire it. Got it on opening day and I have nothing to complain about."

4,"Love the phone. Glad they included the wired headphones as I didn't want to drop another wad of cash for the BT earbuds. In the US, 95% of phones are iPhones; globally 95% are Android. Being in the US with an iPhone is just good common sense (price not considered!). Didn't wait for the X, as I'm just not going to jump that hurdle of a grand for a portable, breakable, easy to lose device."

3,"I purchased a new iPhone 8, unlocked, for a friend. No hassles EXCEPT, when I was asked if I wished a receipt to be sent via email, NONE WAS SENT. In order to be sure I had proof of purchase with AppleCare, I had to return to the store and ask for it to be physically printed. This is not good service. Why is it not possible to access my account, digitally, gain access to the receipt, and print it at home instead of spending time and expense driving?
The phone, by the way, is, as usual, GREAT!"
4,It works. I can make calls on it. I can look up stuff on the ol inter web. Thumbs up!
5,I had the opportunity to test this device early and I love the improved camera and the new wireless charging feature. Great device for anybody who is looking for the latest and greatest device.
