5,This is my first galaxy after being an apple fanboy for years. This is pretty much the perfect phone. It feels compact for having such a big screen. The camera is great and it has a good battery.
2,"The phone it'self is really nice, and has some really nice features, loved the iris scanner, the battery seemed to last a nice amount for me. But within the first day of having it, it would randomly restart, it would happen about 6-10 times a day. Got it swapped out with a new phone.... it did the same thing. After taking it to the Samsung in a local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it. He did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it, but no solution yet. This seems to be a common problem even though it's not being widely reported on. 

Do a search for Galaxy S8 restarting. It's going on 5 weeks since release and no comment from Samsung. See the samsung community boards. People are calling Samsung and they are still telling them 'I've never heard of this"" 

I ended up returning mine before the 14 days."
5,"The Galaxy S8 is a fantastic phone. It has a powerful processor, expandable memory, and is durable against the elements. I only have to minor complaints about the phone. 

1. It's super slippery. The phone is made completely of glass. There is no plastic backing or grip surface anywhere on the phone, so be prepared to buy a necessary case just so you can hold onto the phone.

2. The Bixby button. Bixby is the most useless personal assistant application among all phones. You will find yourself meaning to hit the power button, but wind up pressing the Bixby button (which is right across from the power button) on accident, which starts the Bixby app. While you can turn off access to the Bixby app when you swipe right on the phone, the app will always start when you click the hardwired Bixby button. There is no way to disable this button's functionality in the phone. The best solution I've come up with is to buy a case and pop out the case button that corresponds with the Bixby button so you cannot physically press it. With Bixby now 100% out of my life, the my experience with the phone is phenomenal! I highly recommend the phone!"
5,"I'm an apple guy (multiple iPads, imacs,macbooks), but I've never really warmed up to the iPhone despite all my family having one as well as having my own from work. Quite honestly I'm a longtime blackberry holdout, but the lack of apps finally got to me, almost waited for the new keyone, but bought this instead and am so glad I did. This phone is truly amazing!"
5,"I love this phone! The phone itself is so beautiful and the screen is even better! It feels like I'm holding the future. I upgraded from the galaxy s6 and thought I would really miss the physical home button, but the pressure sensitive home button on the s8 is awesome! I don't mind the placement of the fingerprint scanner, I can still reach it easily on the back. Great front facing camera! Also, the phone comes with a micro usb to usb c adaptor so I don't even need to buy a new car charger!!!"
5,I am very happy with the new s8. It has been very easy to use and hold. I would not go without a case at all and get a screen protector and protection plan asap.
5,"This phone is absolutely amazing. looks good, processes fast and uses less battery life than it's predecessor."
5,"Awesome phone, what else is there to say? Absolutely beautiful design and a stunning display. Packed with plenty of storage for most and enough power to do anything you'd reasonably want a phone to do."
5,"best phone ever,very easy to use with every app and gadjet available.pictures and video are awesome . recently used it camping where there was no tv reception to watch Netflix ,amazon and youtube,paired with screenbeam mini 2 you can stream without wifi connection ."
3,"Overall the phone is ok. However, it seems to activate apps on it's own when it is in my pocket. It pocket dials a lot even though I have locked it before putting it in my pocket. The touchscreen on the bottom instead of the home button is a bit of a hassle. I know the phone has many new features but the battery life is disappointing if you have any real significant use."
4,It's a great phone. Just wish they wld do away with the curved edge of the phone because it seems pointless. Also makes it difficult to use the good screen protectors and phone cases.
4,Wireless earphones do not work well while jogging. Cannot listen to audio because it breaks up
5,"This is the first time owning another phone that wasn't an iPhone. I picked the Galaxy s8 because it had an ear phone jack in addition to a charging jack that Apple removed from their newest phones. At first it was hard to transition from an iPhone. Now having the best camera ever with the Galaxy s8 and now I'm finding I can post faster to Facebook with one button options that iPhone can't compete with. I can add memory without having to rent the cloud, did I say I can add lots of memory that holds every photo! Apple NEVER allows you to add memory with an SD card. Apple always upgraded until your phone would not work anymore, some due to memory issues, not any more with Galaxy s8."
4,The learning curve from being an iPhone user is a little difficult. Otherwise it's an excellent phone.
5,Im very impressed this phone survived one cycle in the washing machine.
5,Samsung hit another home run with the S8. Bixby is the bomb!
5,"Love it my new galaxy s8 gives plenty storage for my 1,000 plus pics and 10000 contacts this phone does everything but take ur blood sugar ill never go back to Apple again #appledivorce"
5,"Former iPhone only user. I dropped my iPhone 6 in the river fishing last week and now it's just a paper weight. I decided that someone like me (active outdoors man) should get a phone that can handle the elements. The galaxy S8 checked off all my needs. The waterproof rating is higher than iPhone and the gorilla glass is stronger. Basically, had I dropped the S8 in the river last weekend, I would still have it. Not to mention it does almost everything better than the iPhone. It has an unbelievable display. I just sit and watch 4K videos on YouTube and annoy my family showing them how amazing it is. The video camera is top notch too. I just love this phone. I bought a UAG case for it (look it up) and now it's even more dynomite. I will have this phone for a LONG time."
4,"To many security loops, it is a lot more complex then my previous s5."
4,"The phone is very good, the price was very good. Got it on sale at $200 off. Plus got $60 in trade for my old Galaxy S5. I'm very pleased with the phone so far. Great design, faster than my old phone, plenty of storage, battery is good. There were a couple of glitches. Some of my apps didn't transfer from my old phone so I had to download them again. And the old phone voice mail didn't get transferred to the new phone. Had to spend quite bit of time with AT&T to fix that. Also, it's still too time consuming and too much paperwork to get a new phone or upgrade. Spent over two hours at Best Buy. There should be a way to streamline all that. But it's a good product and a nice looking phone. It got a case and a screen protector; those are a little pricey for what they are, but necessary. I would give the phone four and a half stars if possible."
3,"The phone is useful but it is not as agile as my S5. It is irritating that something that is made well is removed from market when ""upgrading"" occurs. Why not just update the internals and maintain an already functional format. The curved screen is no big deal the phone just another fad selling point. My expectations are, for the amount of money spent, I want something strong and functional. Don't bother me me with foolish fads."
2,"I realize I have a hard time changing phones however this one is not user friendly. Had to turn off the touch setting as the phone is really sensitive. Swiping through screens frustrating. And......... the battery drains very quickly. Definately not happy with this purchase. I have a bit of time and for the first time in phone purchases, am seriously thinking of returning it!"
5,"So far I am enjoying this phone very much!. It is quick, easy to use and I have already learned how to customize it to my liking. This might seem easy to you, but for a 54 year old that is not smartphone savvy, I think I'm doing good! I have not used the camera much yet, but the pictures I have taken look very good. I still have to try and upload something to FB one of these days. 
 Transferring everything from the old phone to this one was quite easy also. I was fortunate enough to have the people at BestBuy do it for me when I bought it! but all they did was hook up the cables and it pretty much did the work for them.
 I would say I use my phone less than most younger people, so my battery seems to last a good while. I would usually be at 10% battery with my Galaxy 5, but with this Galaxy s8, the lowest I have seen my battery go down to is 55%, so to me, that is a big difference!
 I have not had any issues with calling with this phone, although my wife also has the same phone, and sometimes people have trouble hearing her...but we are not sure if it is her phone or theirs.
 Overall, I am very pleased with this phone, but let's see how it does in the next 6 months or so."
3,its ok definitely better than the tv speakers but i was pretty disappointed with the bass overall its ok but for that price i think it could be a lot better
3,"Nice phone cost is high. Keeps on scanning WiFi channels that I will ever use, need to have a forget network button i could use. I hate seeing it scanning all the time, The Same with blue tooth."
5,Looks great feels great but mostly performs great.
5,I love it great phone good battery life not to big.
5,"Wonderful phone, great colors, battery pretty good. Highly suggest."
5,The new Galaxy S8 met all of my expectations - great camera and easy to use.
5,I'm a big android person and the s8 is a must. Beats the iPhone any day. Great pictures and voice quality.
5,Customization and feel are above anything else on the market.
3,"This phone is beautiful and slim. You will love it when you saw it at the first glimpse. But the OS is kind disappointing. If you install more apps, you get higher chance of slow, stack, and all kinds of problems. Battery drain out very quickly. After using for a few months I now miss iphone..."
5,omg. coolest phone ever. awesome health features. I really enjoy taking pictures with it's amazing camera. I enjoy also getting free beat buy points when I write this review that at least needs to be 80 freaking characters long in order for them to accept this as a legit review. I hope this is enough.
5,"What a great phone! Beautiful screen, incredible pictures, and lots of memory. You can add up to a 256 GB card if you want to. Sleek design with Edge Lighting. The phone is slick, literally. Get a protective cover to help keep you from dropping it!"
5,"The camera really is the winner here! In an assignment for college, our class had to record a video. My phone did things the iphones couldn't, so we unanimously used the Samsung. Everyone was jealous."
5,"Its been over 5yrs since I got a phone, this one felt really nice and fast too."
4,"I'm able use this phone, to do the things I need to access on this phone through apps."
5,"Lots of great new features waterproof,360 camera,pictures are clear and excellent quality,phone easy to use"
5,"Fast, slim and cool. The best Samsung phone yet. And the headphones that come with it are awesome!"
4,"I've had this phone for a few months now and have found it very easy to use. I've previously used an LG and also an iPhone, and I like the display on this better than both of those. My one complaint, though, is how easily the screen gets scratched. I recommend getting a screen protector immediately. I let my husband talk me into waiting a couple days in order to buy a screen protector that was on sale online, and ended up with a scratch on the screen within a couple hours of owning the phone. Even though I was very, very careful, I still somehow got a scratch that annoys me every time I look at my phone,"
5,I buy a couple of this phones for my boys. They really enjoyed.
5,I like it better than the iPhone 8. Better features and more expandable.
5,Great phone; beautiful screen and very useful; slim and agile.
5,"I am new to the android and for a newbie, I am able to operate this phone with ease"
5,I had iPhone before and I hated it samsung is the best
5,"Super fast on multitasking, excelent camera, baterry duration is much better than I'll expected"
4,Overall great phone with a great camera easy to use for everyone
5,Got this for my wife and she loves it she had a note so she wanted a little smaller
3,"phone works well, slide up home and back buttond take some getting used to"
5,Love the color. Just need to get used to not having a home botton. they put good features. samsung such a good brand
5,My daughter loves this phone. It has a great camera! Highly recommend.
5,The camera on this phone is way better than the iPhone camera. Other features are very nice but camera sticks out as the plus!
5,Stunning device! I've had numerous cell phones and this is buying far the best!
5,I replaced my windows phone that I had for so long due to it slipping out of my pocket from a very high position. Ha man have I been missing out for all these years. The difference between these two is crazy. I'm not a big app user but still its crazy. I felt like I just came out of the middle ages. Granted I never lived during the middle ages... or did I?
5,This device has way more features and benefits than an iPhone X. The only thing that makes the iPhone X better is the camera
5,"great phone for a great price, with a cool pre order bonus"
5,I always love my Samsung products and this is no exception. I went from an S7 and appreciate all the updates. The only thing I don't like is not being able to find a tempered glass screen protector that fits well. I've finally given up on it.
4,The phone is pretty cool. It over heats when charging on a wireless charger(I charged it as I slept 12am-6am) but cools instantly. Bixby sucks I liked cortana when I had my htc
5,"Used to have S7 which always heats up and have to remove the case and charge it. Because of that cannot take the phones when charged. Have to use head phones. But S8 doesn't heat up.
It has a great camera and I loved it."
5,I bought this phone for my 19 year old son and he loves it more than any phone he's had. And he's had lots of phones. It's very LifeProof as he is very hard on his phones! He's also a gamer and he says this phone can handle any game that he puts on it.
4,It's a nice phone with good features. I wish they wld do away with the curved edge. It seems pointless. Also makes it difficult to use the good screen protectors and phone cases.
5,Phone is fast and responsive. Great camera pics. Good battery life.
5,"The volume is excellent, the phone design is sleek and slender, fits well one hand for texting, and Bixby is awesome to use!"
4,The touch screen is sometimes hard to use. I do.love the Canada and the speaker goes out though
4,It does the job but there are a lot of glitches such as the text notification not working and it freezes at times.
5,I decided to upgrade to the S8 after the battery on my S6 drained so much and so often. The battery life on the S8 only requires me to charge my phone once per day and hi love it! It's definitely worth upgrading for that reason alone.
5,I have enjoyed the quality of the camera and the size of the screen of my phone.
4,"Pretty good phone. I'm coming from a 10 iphone romance. I've had this phone for 3.5 months and I'm struggling to find a reason to stay. 
PROS: camera, resolution, speed
CONS: autocorrect poor, battery life, need to buy music."
4,"This is a great phone, I would recommend this to the world"
4,I have had my phone for 6 months now and absolutely love it. I upgraded from the G5 and haven't had any regrets getting another Samsung phone.
5,"Before this I had a Samsung Galaxy S5, which I loved. I would have kept it but it got smashed. I use it for the same purpose as the S5. The camera is slightly better, but I don't use all the new features."
4,"I replaced my Galaxy s 5 for this Galaxy 8S. Some features are nice. It was easy to learn the new navigation system. The curved edge means I have to use the plastic screen guard instead of the glass one. The plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils. The charging cable is 10"" shorter than on my Galaxy s5, I have dropped it 3 times this week because of picking it up from the charger and the cord is too short. I never dropped my Galaxy S5. Needs charging daily."
3,Samsung carrier locked phones are just worth a year before they start getting slow. I would have preferred to buy an unlocked phone instead of carrier locked but due to financing options with ATT had to stick with it. Just think twice before going for any samsung smartphones since they have a tendency to slow down quickly and carrier updates are generation old.
5,The screen is gorgeous and the battery is amazing! This is dad one of the best galaxy phones I have ever owned
5,"Love this product, even better got it for a price that couldnt be beat."
5,This phone has so many features & the picture quality is amazing.
3,We got this phone for my boy friend he really doesn't care for it. He has been having alot of Issues with his . It might be just him not doing the needed up dates like I did for the plus.
5,Works really well really happy with it will recommend it
2,i actually returned this device after several days. the narrowness of the phone was not appealing-visually or in use.
5,So far the best cell phone I've ever had. It is fast and also looks very slick.
5,"This is probably one of the top 3 phones of 2017. Best display on a smartphone, amazing camera, super fast, great design and build quality. Would recommend to anyone."
5,"Best cellphone ever made. super fast, the picture quality is amazing."
5,Galaxy s8 is a good phone for me and i love it. In less word you get what you pay for
5,"I purchased this S8 to replace a S5 that had started acting up. Glad we did, this is so much better to do things on than the other, we loved the camera on my old phone but this is way above that one and of course now has the front facing camera also. Extremely happy with purchse and the best buy people were great helping me switch phones and setting new one up"
4,"After a surprise wave flooded my beach blanket and all my stuff, I was pleasantly surprised to have my phone in perfect working condition after the fact. Two weeks following, took a spill into the pool, again working perfectly. Phone even advised me not to charge thru the port until fully dry as moisture was detected. Features are pretty cool. Nice and sleek. However, it freezes often enough to annoy me wherein i have to hold down 3 buttons until my fingers hurt 15 secs later to restart it and wait 3 mins before fully reloaded. When I say often, its been maybe 8 times total in 2 months? Enough to have gotten annoying. But I am super active on my phone, with apps and searching, etc, so I am assuming it has to do with using up my ram and needing a reboot, just like my laptop would. Very happy with the phone, staying in the galaxy family, but finally having some water protection gives alot of peace of mind. Also was easy to find a nice case I liked on amazon much cheaper than an otterbox. Liking Unicorn Beetle brand cases. Holds tough!"
5,"Smoothest function, best camera... Greatest phone experience you can get. Bought it through best buy presale... the bestbuy associate transferred all the data and set it up for me in just a few minutes... Love the phone, love best buy experience."
5,"Samsung 8 love it, easy to use and the Best Buy tech was great!"
5,Great phone. Battery life is very good. Only complaint is Bixby keeps popping up.
5,"Great phone. Only frustration is that Bixby keeps popping up. Haven't tried Bixby and don't really see any reason to use it, but maybe I am missing something."
4,Going from a S5 to the S8 was a great move. It's so much faster and in general just runs better.
4,Going from a S5 to the S8 was a great move. It's so much faster and in general just runs better.
5,Great phone easy to use. Outstanding picture quality!
5,Family plan & my son loves this new phone. This was an early Christmas gift for 2017!!!
4,"I was a IPhone user, Swithched to android [ Samsung] liked most of it comparatively but when it comes to keyboard typing. I will still say iPhone is the best."
5,"I had been eyeing this phone among a couple of others and the battery life, screen quality, etc finally made me decide on this phone. Best Buy beat out any others by a long shot for price."
5,My best purchase yet.....love the phone and my color choice....
5,I love my new phone. It is everything I expected and more
5,This phone is awesome. You will not be disappointed!
5,"great phone. the camera takes outstanding pictures, and the battery lasts longer than most other phones."
5,Absolutely love how affordable this phone was. Such a great piece of technology and it takes amazing photos!
4,Love this phone. Is great and easy to use. Couldn't be better
4,"I got this for my hubby when his Galaxy 6 was stolen. At first, he told me to take it back and get him a 6. He failed to realize, that was no longer an option. That being said, he learned to love this phone! He figured out the new, more up to date and handy options, as well as loving the speed of the new phone. He says it will be buried with him! I'm sure by the time that happens, we will have the Galaxy 50 (or even newer model) available!"
4,"I purchased this phone for my 16-year-old son. He had been living with the Galaxy S4 for several years so he knew he wanted to stay with Samsung. This phone has all the bells and whistles! Clear pictures, super fast processing. He mostly texts, YouTubes and listens to music - no actually phone calling - so I can't speak to all the other features, but he's happy so I'm happy."
1,Bought new phone pd. $750. i move 90 days no unlock so i have lack of enjoyment of use due to Best Buy
5,"If you have ever used a Samsung phone, you will love this. It's breathtaking, and so fast!"
5,Great Samsung - Galaxy S8 64GB - Orchid Gray from (AT&T).
5,I enjoy the upgraded features compared to my last phone.
5,"I am loving the S8, the size is perfect, not too large while retaining a large display. Fast & smooth performance, great camera, wireless charging and a gorgeous display."
4,it is truly my every rhing amd now.Im looking into buying a Samsung Smart TV.
5,I finally upgraded to the Samsung 8. I've never had a problem with Samsung phones. Just loving the edge features; so convenient. I prefer my personal android phone over my work issued iPhone.
5,"I purchased this phone for my dad. Great phone, nice battery life, awesome camera. He loves it!"
5,Beautiful design and great screen resolution. Rear camera doesn't have dual lenses but still takes great pictures.
4,"The battery life on the Samsung S8 smartphone is a great improvement over previous models, as is the camera. I find the Bixby feature a bit annoying and could probably do without it. It certainly doesn't have nearly the capability of Alexis or Sir I.

Overall the S8 is a good, but probably overpriced, product."
5,"Really can't say there's anything wrong with this phone, other than Bixby, Samsung's Siri. Interfaces are great, camera awesome, comfortable to hold and work with. But Bixby is not really accurate with speak to text for me, to the point that I get annoyed trying to use it."
5,"I bought this phone for my teenage daughter. In her words this phone is ""awesome""."
5,"I bought this phone for my teenage son. In his words this phone is ""nifty""."
5,Wow this phone is thin. It has a crystal clear picture and is very fast processing information. Works great on AT&T network.
5,"switched over from iphone and now can not understand how i was satisfied with apple products in general. first of all the design of the phone is off the charts trendy. aside from the looks, the phone has so many features that apple can not compete with (i.e. bixby, samsung pay, etc.). overall LOVE the phone and do not regret making the switch."
5,"This is my 3rd Galaxy S series device and as always, this one has not disappointed at all. 

Excellent screen - a beauty to behold, awesome camera quality in both outdoor and low-light conditions, and a battery life to last 2 days with medium usage. 

Just wish that the Blue color had been around when I bought this."
5,Would recommend this phone to anyone it's worth it.
5,"Just got this phone a week ago, it works great, I love the way it looks and how slim it is. It's not a huge difference from the s8+, but I prefer it this size. If you have the s7 edge, it's definitely an upgrade. It's slimmer, and looks like it's 5 years newer than the s7 edge. The only thing is that I setup the fingerprint, but it's in the back, by the camera, so I haven't needed it yet. Overall a great purchase."
5,"Great graphics, love Samsung. Simple to operate. So similar to my S7"
5,I upgraded from the S6 and it was worth it. Everything about the S8 is great.
4,"Had an old phone, needed to upgrade, I love my new phone!"
4,No issues and a great phone. 4 stars because of the lack of Bixby.
4,"Lots faster than S5 I had. Has some nice features, but has its quirks too that I am still figuring out. Think some of them are thanks to ATT!"
5,My son is a gamer and hasn't had any complaints about the phone yet.
5,First smart phones for the family - easy to use. Large screen - protective case highly recommended.
5,"I was undecided of the phone that I wanted, but I love the full screen and camera on this device."
5,"Awesome phone with big screen, great picture quality and sound."
5,Thanks to best buy for selling unlocked phones!! Awesome phone with no carrier bloatware!
5,"Samsung made the Galaxy S8 with exactly the same features as it's bigger brother, the Galaxy S8-plus. So if you want a smaller phone with world-class features, this is a great choice. Both of these phones are narrower than previous phones, so they both are easier to hold in one hand."
5,Really nice phone. Good camera and long battery life.
4,Replaced an older smartphone. Big jump in features. I find that the battery life a little better than old phone with a caveat. You need to put the battery on mid power to last the day. I'm going to assume there is just too many programs running in the background sucking juice. Other than that it's a great phone. Screen is super clear.
3,The new Galaxy has features that I don't really need. My 5S was fine except I dropped too many times and it didn't hold a charge. The curved edge on this phone takes a little getting used to; I have missed sending many texts because you have to tap the curve.
5,I love my samsung galaxy s8!! I would recommend this phone to anyone. Great camera and easy to use.
5,I had the Google Pixel for a while which is an excellent android phone but when I played with the S8 I had to have it. The camera is amazing and the fact that it can be dunked in water has already paid for itself.
5,The screen is amazing! It is crazy fast and does everything I need.
1,Constantly freezes so that you have to reset and only to find your battery has drained by more than half!
4,This is a really nice iPhone case it keeps my phone safe
5,Went from an iPhone to android. Love some features that were to available on iphone.
4,"display is excellent, takes great pictures. battery lasts a long time."
5,This is the best phone I have ever owned it also has a lot of features
4,"it has a lot of features my old galaxy didn't have. so much technology for me to get use to, but once I was used to it, it is more than I will need"
5,Phone has so much to offer that I have it for about a month now and still haven't even scratched the surface try it for your self
5,The phone has so many great feature so get one for yourself
5,This phone has great battery life and is waterproof! I recently upgraded from the samsung s6 edge and easily could tell a difference in battery life! I recommend this phone and buying a case a soon as you purchase.
5,"The Galaxy S8 is a huge step up from the LG G4. Excellent camera, amazing features and the display is phenomenal."
5,"Great phone! Excellent picture quality, water proof, 64G of memory, expandable with sim card."
5,"Picked up the Samsung S8 last week, and it is an excellent phone."
4,I had problems with my S7 Active and upgraded to an S8. There are some features that I do not want and hard to get rid of i.e.: Bixby. Even though it runs better than my S7 active but I do still have to occasionally restart to clear out issues.
5,"When my Galaxy S5 started acting very sluggish, I started looking around online for reviews of newer model phones. The Samsung Galaxy line remained top in the line in regards to what my needs/wants were and I was back and forth between the S6, S7, and S8. I was not necessarily looking for the newest model, but after talking with the sales rep in the Best Buy store, it was the better deal to go with the new S8. I must say, I am extremely happy with my S8 and the buying experience. I am still finding new things that the phone does every day and the features are pretty awesome. The display is amazing, great battery life, and great phone!"
5,Purchased for my son...great phone. He loves all the new features.
5,Got this for my daughter and she loves it! Great new features.
5,Pretty good. Lots of updates keep down loading. Room for lots of apps.
5,This phone has built in apps for fitness tracking.
4,"Love this phone, Camera is great. So much betther than my old HTC"
4,"This phone is ok but I liked my old phone better. It has some good features but not many ringtones to choose from and I don't particularly like the ones available. (MHO). I can not find where it shows if I have a voicemail. Maybe I just need to give this phone sometime and I will be able to figure it out. Also, not a fan of the size."
4,I am Previous iPhone user .Comparatively high secured phone with good performance.
5,The Samsung - Galaxy S8 4G LTE with 64GB Memory Cell Phone is a good replacement for my previous Galaxy
5,"The new S8 is brighter and clearer than my old note. The voice transmission is much clearer than my old phone. The internet connections are faster and more up to date. I noticed some Apps have improved functionality on the new phone. Overall, very nice. I've only been using it a little over a month and still transitioning from my old phone. Overall, it seems really good."
5,Love the phone. It has everything I wanted. Great camera and screen quality
5,I love Best Buy prices and promotions. They have the best price match program
4,"Nice phone, I'm still trying to adjust to this type of screen as it is very different than previous phones"
5,Upgraded my Note4 to S8. Best move ever in phones. Have not been disappointed yet. Bixby could be better but its a work in progress.
5,Bought this about a month ago. Love this phone upgraded from a Note4. Bixby could be better but the phone itself is great.
4,"Found transitioning to the new Galaxy S8 rather challenging. It seems more like an I Phone. If I wanted an I Phone, I would have bought an I Phone. No manual to down load. I am finally working my way through all the updates and sure will eventually love it. Just very hard to find help in the process. Still would recommend it though."
5,My wife and I replaced our S4 phones with S8's. We love these phones. Best is the ability to make phone calls over our WIFI as our house does not have good cell reception.
5,My wife and I replaced our S4 phones with S8's. We love these phones. Best is the ability to make phone calls over our WIFI as our house does not have good cell reception.
4,The camera is amazing. The screen is superb. The downfall is the new port to charge and the lack of accessories for the phone.
5,I had Samsung all my life. It is the best phone I've purchased so far.
5,Feature packed. Works great. Does all and then some more
5,Best Buy folks transferred all programs and data within 30 minutes. Walked out hardly realizing I had a new phone. Super fast with plenty of storage.
5,I like the phone so far. The color is gorgeous. Still trying out new features. Great battery life so far.
5,"I have had numerous other galaxies, but this one takes the cake. Even better than the G5 it replaced."
5,I was not sure if I should upgrade my phone at this point but I am glad I did. Samsung S8 is the best phone yet.
5,The infinity screen is gorgeous and for media consumption you can find no better current mobile option IMO. It is fast at all tasks and the slim design makes it much easier to handle in your hand.
5,"Nice slim phone, excellent battery life, takes great pictures, sound is very clear"
5,I love how Samsung found a middle ground with the edge display. It's comfortable to hold without feeling like you're going to drop it like the s7 edge. The infinity screen is gorgeous! Easily the best screen on the market. Love pro mode on the camera for manual settings. Only gripe. I don't use Bixby so having an entire button devoted to it is super annoying. Wish I could program the button to open whatever I wanted. Still 5 star quality.
5,"I had a Samsung Galaxy S5 for many years and I was satisfied with it. However, after reading about the new S8 model, and watching it from one of my sons, I decided to buy it. I am very pleased with that decision. It is an excellent device, with many new features, easy to use, and its design is nice."
3,"There are a lot of great aspect to this phone but it's not as adaptable as other phones. There a certain things that you can't change or controlle that is more of an annoyance with this phone. For instance, the text dictionary. Normally when you try and say one thing the phone will auto correct it to what it THINKS you were trying to say. Then when you change that specific word or sentence, there is a way to add to dictionary. But not on this phone. This next sentence will be unaltered so you can see what I'm taking about. ""In whay way dies auto correct dies this"". Its supposed to say ""in what way does auto correct does this "". So now your left repeating the same mistakes over and over again... its annoying. There should be a way do add words to your dictionary so you don't have to keep editing what you're trying to say. There isn't. 

The other thing that kinda annoys me is that they have all these hi-tech ways of opening your phone like retina recognition, finger print, voice activated, etc.. but they don't have the most basic thing and it annoys the he'll out of me. And that's double tap to open. IT. DOES. NOT. EXIST. On this phone. They have a list of ways to unlock your phone, and they are all really cool. But I just want basic. To open my phone when its off shouldn't be a process. Just double tap screen to turn on, pattern lock to open. And done. 

There are other annoying things but i won't go into details about it. 

The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because they do have great featureson this phone. But the texting does suck. Last sentence for this review unaltered. ""I had to changethe spelling on each sentence and granger at least ten aspirate times before i out a period down, have fin translating this. """
5,"Easy to use, setup was not a problem, removing unwanted apps is a dream"
5,The Samsung S8 is a great phone. The pictures I've been able to take are of outstanding quality!
5,"Love this phone! The camera is wonderful, super clear photos!"
5,"The display on this phone is incredible. I was blown away by how much screen they fit into a phone no bigger than a regular iPhone. Super fast, super responsive."
5,Still getting use to it has great features did some videos and can make them hd
5,"I had no idea how restrictive iOS was until I made the switch to android. The customization options are nearly unlimited, and expandable memory is an awesome feature. Samsung has built one of the sleekest, aesthetically-appealing phones. Hardware specs are comparable if not superior to the iPhone, and all for a fraction of the price! Google and Samsung, keep up the good work!"
4,Enjoying my new S8 very much. My Daughter as well.
5,"I upgraded from an s5 to the s8 and the difference between the two phones is amazing. The phone is fast and the camera takes amazing pictures. No shutter lag at all. While I can't compare this to an iPhone since I've never had one, it's a huge step up from my older s5 and am happy with the purchase so far."
5,It replaced my old Samsung Galaxy galaxy 3 which I had had for a very long time. Eli at Best Buy was extremely helpful in changing everything over. I LOVE the phone!!
5,"Such a fast processing phone, has 4 gigs of RAM. Camera is awesome and also the curved screen is cool. I recommend the otter box screenless defender case. No screen protector is required if you're careful enough."
4,I love my new samsung. The display and graphics are amazing.
5,"Big screen but not too wide fits your hand perfectly is an exelent cellphone, not too big but huge screen for the size and price but the Bixby key is kind of annoying."
5,good camera and also edge screen. a lot of storage
4,Best Buy gave a free wireless charger that Samsung says is incompatible. I was very disappointed. It does not work.
4,My daughter loves her new Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.
4,"So far so good, I like most of the new upgrades, but there are a few things that take getting use to. Better than the s7."
4,"I went from an S4 to the Galaxy S8, so the performance and speed are greatly improved in my situation. The phone is easy to use, after a few days of adjustment. Still having difficulty with Bixby and the voice recognition. I do wish there were not so many pre-installed apps. They are confusing, clutter up the phone, and I will probably not use half of them, but it is unclear if I can delete them without harming the phone. I prefer to select my apps. One feature I definitely do not appreciate is the auto-correct. I would rather risk some spelling errors in my texts than to have my words changed. I have actually sent out few texts that did not even make sense because the phone made ""corrections"" that I didn't notice in time. Still haven't found a way to turn this feature off. But overall, I love the new phone and would recommend it."
4,"Still learning features, great that there are classes to attend to educate yourself on phone. Wish there were Skype capable classes for the physically challenged phone owner though."
5,"great design, fits perfectly in my hand, Superb display. Was easy to transfer my data from 950xl. Excellent photos. Many features makes it a pleasure to use. Multi window display capability is great."
3,I've previously switched off between Samsung and Apple before and it's never been easy but I haven't been able to sync my email on this new s8 and I have to say I'm disappointed. Besides that the picture quality is really good.
5,"Screen, audio, speed, battery etc all great upgraded from a iphone 6 first time android user n so far loving it! Highly recommend"
5,Works well. Touchy screen sides that switch it easily
5,Just have to watch when you get near the side it flips screens
5,I absolutely love my new galaxy s8. The camera is the best i've ever seen
5,"I have typically stayed away from Samsung phones because they are so expensive, instead opting for the unlocked ""budget"" phones or Nexus devices. With the elimination of the Nexus program for the Pixel, that isn't an option anymore.
When my latest phone broke, I went for the Galaxy S8. Its worth the price. This phone is a homerun as it checks every single box for an Android phone, or any smart phone.
The screen is the best available. I know that folks will say the iPhone screen is the best, but if you do a side by side, fair comparison, the GS8 wins. The Samsung software is much improved. I have long been down on the TouchWiz UI and instead preferred vanilla Android. I still do, but this version of TouchWiz -- or Samsung User Interface -- is far less obtrusive. Its more like stock Android.
The camera is excellent. It may not be the best on the market, but its ""right there"" in all settings and in each instance a case can be made that it is the best. For what I need, quick pics of my kids, its quick and does a great job.
With waterproofing and a microSD slot, QuickCharging.. it has it all.
Sure, its expensive, but if will certainly get you through a two year ""contract"" or ""payment plan."""
5,I love this phone. Battery lasts me all day and I use it constantly. Display is beautiful. Bixby is a work in progress but has a ton of potential. I upgraded from a note 5 and I am glad I did!
5,Best phone that I've had so far. Very easy to use.
4,Functionality and screen size are goodbut the battery life still is something to be desired.
2,"I had the phone exactly 3 weeks when it asked for an update. After the update, the phone was DEAD. Before the update, my phone had over 85% charge and was working perfectly. Then after the update, it would not turn on or show the light when plugged in for charging. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with tech who had me hold down every combo of buttons possible and nothing. I have never dropped my phone and it was only 3 weeks old...essentially brand new. According to many online posts, this has been a constant problem with the new phone especially since you can no longer remove the battery for a hard reboot. This is so disappointing. I have always raved about Samsung products...now my faith is shaken : ("
1,I got my phone on Tuesday 2 wks later on a Tuesday I tried to return it because the day before it was freezing up. Unable to return it because they said it was 15 days. So I'm stuck with a phone that freezes up all the time. I do like the quality of the pictues.
4,It is a nice phone and have a good speed and display.
4,Have only had the S8 for about a week after migrating from the S5 so Im still getting used to it and getting familiar with all the features so I can only give it 4 stars at this point. It might be a 5 star phone but I just don't know yet. Im still not sure what to think about the Bixby feature. I need to get more familiar with it to see if it is worthwhile or not for my needs. So far I like the phone just fine. There's definitely a performance over the S5 as there should be. Not knocking the S5 but newer phones should perform better with more memory and faster processors.
5,the screen clarity is excellent and I noticed the screen doesn't show smudge marks like my old one
5,"I have owned every iPhone since the first, a slave to the apple logo.
The only major changes in 10 years was going from 3G to LTE and the size change. Everything else was basically the same. I looked at the S8 plus, played with it and bought it. I'm learning android (like learning Chinese) I love the challenge and it's so much more fun than the old IOS and so very customizable. Great look, feel and fast as lightning. Got a $200 discount on the phone and went to ATT and got a S350 S3 Frontier watch for $49. I can forget my phone and if my wife calls and tells me she forgot to tell me to pick something up, I answer my watch. Works great. My Best Buy experience was great, I love my new OLED Samsung and phone insurance is 50% less than ATT. No longer a slave to the Apple logo. PS, the Best Buy phone folks are much more friendly, knowledgeable, and unbiased than Apple store (no one really like going to the Apple store) 73 and still learning."
4,"It's a little different than the Samsung phone I had but I like it. The one thing I miss is changing the size of the text. I wish it were a little larger. I'm still learning what everything does.
."
5,My husband really likes this phone. Gives him everything he needs.
5,Wonderful phone. Love the color. Holds all the apps that I need.
5,"I've owned and used Samsung phones including the Captivate and Note 2, iPhones 5, 6+ and 6S+, and the Nokia Lumia 1520. The S8, so far, has been the best I've owned. The screen is amazing, the phone is responsive, and it just feels and looks futuristic."
2,"After 2days experience I returned this phone and reactivated my old Galaxy S5, a way better and more practical tool for a man with bigger fingers, did not like the rounded edges and small key board. Also the phone was longer and very slippery, would even slide off a table due to loud music vibrations. NOT FOR ME"
5,Switching to the Unlimited Plus Plan with AT&T was one of the best decisions I ever made! My dad loves his brand new phone and can't stop using it!!!
5,I love my new Samsung Galaxy S8. Takes beautiful photos.
5,"Love the phone, just wish Best Buy had cases for the phone. I had to buy one elsewhere. The phone is great very clear, and sharp."
5,Buy one get one free! Pretty sweet phone. Bought for my daughter and it's the most functional phone yet.
5,"Great size, fast, reliable. Best edge I've ever seen."
5,"I have spent a lot of time finding out all the featured of this phone and love everything about it. Although I'm not a huge fan of curved screens, I find that they aren't an issue with this phone. The screen isn't curved as much as the previous edge phone's and it makes viewing photos and videos very nice on this phone. The camera takes beautiful pictures and videos, and sound on this device is also very good. Battery life is also really good. The only con of the phone is trying to find a glass screen protector for it that works. So far I have only found that the Zagg glass one works and is case friendly."
4,"We did have too return it after 14 days for a small glitch 
It froze up when we used Skype 
I think we did the right thing by returning and no hiccups from Best Buy they had no problem with the return and it was through att and att did not charge anything Extra in fact they cancel the other pione and did not have to make a payment this month"
4,This phone is simply an improvement from previous editions!
5,"not sure yet if I will regret not getting the 8+, but so far this has been a great phone"
5,Its amazing how much the features of the new galaxy has changed from the last one! My husband loves his phone!
4,Very responsive phone. Battery life is okay. I prefer the fingerprint scanner to the facial recognition. Other features are nice.
4,Only had it about two weeks but so far I am enjoying the phone. I am enjoying all the features and the responsiveness of the phone.
4,Glad I didn't have to learn a new system from my s6.
5,My husband upgraded my s5 now I feel update to date with my co workers thx
5,I find it a huge upgrade from my s5 better in every way like so much I upgraded my wife's s5
5,awesome screen must get a good case because there are two glass on phone. love unlocking with iris scan
5,Love the size...excellent quality all around. Nice big screen too.
5,Have only had this for a week. Transitioning from Samsung 4 and so far I am finding it easy. Light weight and sleek and the camera is excellent!! The colors are beautiful! Still have lots to learn!
5,Great phone and looks really good. Wife loves it!!
5,"I like this phone so far, but I also liked my S6 Active before the battery stopped working."
4,daughter loves s8 loves the screen and likes the thiness of it fits in her hand comfertabally she always has used samsung im pretty sure
5,I love my Samsung Galaxy S8. I like the updated features.
5,Samsung has not disappointed. Another quality phone.
3,Samsung created a beautiful phone but the lag is still there. I'm actually surprised at how bogged down this phone gets from simple use.
5,We bought a new AT&T Galaxy S8 from BestBuy. The sales representative set it up for us and transferred all of our data from our old phone to our new one. The process was simple and we appreciated it. She then showed us the basic operations of the phone to get us started. The purchase was simple and reasonably quick.

5,"Didn't think I would ever give up my Note 5, but yeah, S8 is awesome!"
5,"The phone has a high quality camera, fantastic adaptive display response time. It makes my pictures look amazing. Not to mention the design of the sleep screen is convenient and readable. The pixel quality is superb. Love the audio quality, much crisper and cleaner. Not to mention the decibel at which it plays is a lot louder than previous versions."
5,what's not to like? Great Samsung phone. Purchased this phone for my wife. I purchased the S7 Edge last year and she loves the S8
2,Doesn't hold a charge for long. The Bixby button is annoying and useless.
5,It is very easy to use and the camera is fantastic! I love Samsung products
5,"Can't say enough about this phone. Graphics quality is absolutely amazing, as is the sound quality. You won't be disappointed."
5,Switched from iPhone to this new galaxy and I love
4,Galaxy S8 has a great visual display and camera. Bixby not fully functional which is the reason for 4 stars.
5,"S8+ is the best phone out, from the camera to thw battery life you will not be dissapointed!"
5,The color is very bright and nice. It is a balance between S8 and S8 plus. It is nice to have a smaller unit in hand where finger can reach across the screen when you try to type.
5,My daughter loves it! She claims it's far superior from the S7.
5,The camera on this phone is great. Easy to use and not to heavy
4,"It looks nice, not sold on the curved screen. I really don't get the point, it just makes it harder to put a drop proof case on it. I would have kept s7"
5,Great phone the only problem is you must have a case or else it slips out of your hand without warning.
5,I went from android to iPhone. Desperately anticipated the release of this phone to go back to Android. Great phone and love the features.
5,Phone is great. Easy to use and the camera takes fantastic pictures. Very happy with my choice.
4,Galaxy s8 is a great phone. Best Samsung phone yet.
4,Upgraded from Galaxy S5; big improvement. Screen and display are great. Camera is not as great as they claim. The orchid grey color is definitely cool.
5,Samsung has nailed it again. Superb. Way better than boring iPhone.
5,"Great functionality, excellent and easy to use menus, great camera."
5,New phone and customer service was Great! So knowledgeable!
5,Best galaxy phone hands down I have no complaints at all.
5,This is my 2nd galaxy phone after using the iPhone for years before that. Galaxy is my favorite.
5,"I've always been skeptical of the flagship Galaxy phones from Samsung every year. They've always been made out of plastic, and the Samsung custom apps and UI they forced on the user were horrendous. However, the Galaxy S8 is the first time I've truly considered & purchased a Galaxy phone because of the improvements to build quality/material, and less bloatware pre-loaded on the phone. It's really a great phone with great battery life & phenomenal camera."
5,"Love it!!! Samsung S8, it is easy to work with, it has all your need gor daily use and the camera it is great. My kids always use my phone to take pictures."
2,Nice design but hindered by bad operat8ng system. Great display though
5,I love this S8 it's so much better than the 7 better features
5,"Great screen, battery life and overall easy phone to use."
5,Best galaxy to date! I love the fact that they got rid of the actual home screen button. Thats one less thing to go wrong. Camera is spectacular also!
5,Upgrading from a S6. This phone is an upgrade in every way. No complaints except the worrying about dropping the phone.
4,"I never spend a great deal of money on a phone, as most do. I was inclined to with a $200 price cut on this Galaxy S8. I have some issues seeing small icons and print. This phone is extremely customizable and this has made a huge difference for me, not just for my vision but for preferences with reminders, notifications, and other individualized items. Slim and easy to put in pocket. Definitely holds a charge much longer than I'm used to, can actually get to 40% and not cut out on me. Very easy to use."
5,"Great phone, big screen, good battery life, waterproof, nice glass and aluminum feel, and it has a headphone jack."
5,"Great phone! Fast, light, sleek and excellent new features!"
5,This was the best choice for my budget and the features it offered. It has been a pretty easy transition from my previous phone. The voice sound quality is better than I had. The picture quality is excellent. It is light weight and just the right size.
5,Great .............................................
5,This phone has such a pretty screen & charges fast
5,"It is still new to me; however, it has proven, in the amount of time I have
had it, to be a good choice of mobile phones."
5,This phone has been great so far. I bought because of the great camera.
5,Is a very good and resistant phone. I really liked it and recommend it
4,"A great phone. This is my first experience with the ""edge"" and I really do like it. I'm using a lot more data now and need to figure out what of all these good features I can do without! One thing bad so far, I was not happy with the conversion of my contacts. Lost a bunch! Bad news."
4,"Have not had my S8 long, but love the features that I have found so far!"
5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an amazing phone with great battery and plenty of power. The screen looks stunning, and if you like using the Samsung Gear VR, than this phone is for you. The phone never overheats, which is an issue I had with my S6."
5,"Reluctanly updraded my Windows Mobile phone due to lack of upogrades. Digging Android, I am officially in the new century. Samsung makes a great phone, video is superior, easy to use and setup. Camera is good, not on par with my old Lumia 1020. Android is more customizable (like Windows) than Apple, hence my choice to the Galaxy S8."
5,This is a GREAT improvement over the previous Samsung Edge.
4,"went from a note 4 to this, great phone, alot of improvements..."
5,"Switched from a Lumia 950 and have been really happy. Great battery, smooth performance, nice screen, and good size for my hands."
5,"the galaxy S8 is by far the best phone samsung has ever put out. the display is beautiful, android runs nicely and the phone camera is far better than any digital camera i have ever owned."
4,"a good phone, thought set could be a little easier but a lot of that is because of who you have your phone service with"
5,I've only had the S8 for a few weeks but so far love it! Had an S5 and it was time for an upgrade and so far am glad I got the S8.
5,I upgraded from the S6 to the S8. The camera is definitely better and I can't wait until I learn more about all the new apps. I would highly recommend for people who have been android users
5,We have always had Samsung phones since the first Galaxy and the biggest complaint has been about the battery. This phone has a much better battery but the charger is not compatible with old Galaxy phones.
4,"The case seems to be good quality, and I like the feel of it.
Time will tell."
5,"Beautiful phone, so clear, camera editing is great, pictures sharp, luv that's it's waterproof. Size is just right....still fits in my back Jean pockets. I have no compla inte about this product."
5,"Great phone, love the battery life, much better than the S6 battery life, camera takes excellent pictures. Love the size of the phone also, fits nicely in my hand. Like the new overall features, home button etc."
5,Great phone. Upgraded from an older model Galaxy. Still exploring all of the available features.
5,This phone is user friendly. And has an awesome camera. Also everything to keep you organized.
5,No surprises with Samsung. They delivered exactly as promised
5,"Very responsive, slim, beautiful phone. Charges fast and seems solid."
5,I've been a Galaxy owner since the 1st one and the 8 has almost more features than you can discover.
5,The phone has a very sleek look to it and it is the perfect size even though it isn't the plus. Battery life is very efficient as well.
5,It is a very good phone for the money . It has more stuff than I would ever use . But I know if I do need it it will be there .
2,So far not happy with this phone at all. Voice sucks . S7 SO much better . New port plug on this too .
5,"If you will excuse the cliche, this Samsung's latest and greatest. There is too much to say about this in a short review, but here are some highlights. 

Pros:
-Great camera with pro mode for photographers like me and other great modes like hyperlapse (haven't tried it yet)
-Very fast phone. Apps launch quickly. 
-Lots of storage space at 64GB.
-Gorgeous screen. I am not sure the curved part is an advantage, but this AMOLED makes things look amazing.
-Great battery life and fast charging works great with the included charger. 
-Came with a great deal on the Gear 360 if purchased about the same time. I have wanted a 360 camera for a while. 

Cons
-The curved screen can make it a challenge to touch the edges of the screen and makes it possibly more vulnerable to drops. 
-The longer shape makes it easier for it to fall out of your shirt pocket and is non-standard. I'm not sure why they chose this ratio. 
-No removable battery for when you are away from a charger for long periods of time. 

I upgraded from a Galaxy S4. Overall, I am very happy with the S8 and highly recommend it."
5,Love it so far. I would recommend it to all my friends.
4,"Great phone, easy setup and comes with great accessories."
5,Had to order it online because they kept having problems at the store with their computer was their over a hour just to go home and do it in 5 mins
5,"I saw the hype about the new phone. But it had my undying attention from the first 5 minutes. I won't be able to use 30% of it probably, but is is so nice!"
5,"This phone is one of the best I had. Very fast, smooth, elegant. I recommend it"
5,After using this for a couple weeks the device feels great in hand and the display is great. Overall the interface is snappy and the battery life is good enough but not great.
4,Good camera and fast but touch screen sensitivity not the greastest.
5,Great camera and super light. The phone is definitely better than the s7.
4,"The phone works well and I am have a great time using it. I thought it would be hard to find a screen protector that fits the phone because I had the same problem on my s7 edge but it was so easy to find one. However, compared to iPhones the battery life is still a like lacking in Samsung's part. Overall it is still a great phone!"
4,I have had the galaxy4s for 4 years just upgraded to the 7. Very similar. I love the phone. Camera great. Don't have any complaints.
5,I am happy to get such a good mobile to use person
5,"Love the new S8! Easy to get used to, lots of fun to tinker with."
4,I love my phone specially the camara and th ecolor
5,Thanks! For the extra time spent to make sure everything was in order with ATT!
5,"The Galaxy S8 is the best phone in the world, hands down. It's absolutely stunning to look at with its beautiful appeal, absolutely awesome Crystal Clear camera views, the battery life is extremely long and I don't charge my phone but every 2 days and I use it all the time."
5,"The phone is so cool, but even better was the customer service. The store help took their time and assisted my wife through the entire process. Five star service for this store. I love Best Buy, great rices, deals and assistance. Beats the heck out of Amazon."
5,I bought the Samsung galaxy S7.I was happy with the purchase. The sales staff was great.
5,Since upgrading from s5 this was a major upgrade. Screen much nicer and big enough that do not see need to buy slightly larger s8 plus. Pictures from camera are great
5,Great upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S5. Much faster and better graphics
5,"This is a great improvement over my Galaxy S5. Faster, more memory, more storage, brilliant display, overall, an excellent phone."
4,"After every update, some else seems to me messed up after it fixes the previous issue."
5,"I am still learning this phone, but I do enjoy the easy access, security and speed of it. It has a bright screen and knows me in just a week."
5,I love this new Phone it is the best samsung i have ever used and this one is my 4th one! the camera is Amazing and it has so many Filters Like snapchat built in to the Phone. it is fast has amazing amount of storage and the battery lasts the longest
5,Love this phone battery is good for a smartphone love the big full screen it's great thanks best buy and I got $200 off
4,Easy to use a lot of features. Battery last very long.
4,Easy to use a lot of features. Battery last very long
2,My phone was working perfectly fine for about a week. Then it started restarting multiple times in a row. Some days if I'm lucky it wouldn't restart all day but it was basically Russian Roulette. I'm planning on exchanging mine for another since my insurance won't let me switch to an S7. But if you have the choice don't make my mistake just go with the S7 since it is the older one and doesn't have as many bugs.
5,I my self would have gone with the s8+ but my wife loved the s8. Overall amazing phone especially when it comes to a teacher's life. My wife loves how organizes it's keeping her. Def recommend upgrading
5,I've been an iPhone user for many years and just switched from iPhone 6 to the Galaxy S8 and I love this phone! Definitely more fun than an iPhone and runs smooth and fast. Camera quality is simply AMAZING as well!
5,"Love the Galaxy S8. If you like Android, look no further. This phone meets and exceeds my expectations."
5,"My daughter needed a new phone and always has had a iphone, she got the galaxy s8 and this phone is better than my galaxy s6 and galaxy s7"
5,"The mere fact that this phone is not only water resistant, but actually 50 ft waterproof is awesome. When browsing phones to replace my beloved LG G3 I was also looking for a waterproof case to do some underwater pics on an upcoming vacation. Well, everyone I spoke to (including the Samsung rep) said that this phone is actually waterproof and other than saltwater, it will handle any beach pics I can take. That's pretty cool. Water damage is what helped kill many of my past phones. So that will help mucho."
5,My wife got this s8 and seems to love it. Havent heard any complaints so far.
5,I have had no issues with this product and love all the features it has to offer!!!
5,This is the best phone i have had in years!!!!!! Definitely recommend to friends.
5,"So, I've been a LG product subscriber for a long time. Though I love the LG family, the Samsung Galaxy S8 wins in the ""cell phone department"" hands down. I challenge you, try this phone for one committed week, and you'll see why I love it."
4,"A slight improvement over the last Galaxy, no more physical home button."
5,"So many improvements, so much new technology, so many options will keep me interested until it is time to buy a new phone. Right now this does it all and more."
5,Nice product and good deals . With plenty of options
5,User-friendly. Great battery life. Apps work smoothly and make using this phone so easy and the photos are beautiful. A definite improvement from my old Galaxy S4. Just hate the Zagg protector for this phone.
5,"This phone is just perfect for me. It has more features than I need but I appreciate all the improvements that was made to this Android device especially the waterproof, it allows me to be a bit careless and it is a relief. The camera gives me such beautiful resolution."
5,"I bought this phone for my wife, and so far she likes it. She loves the picture quality for taking pictures and videos of the grand kids, very clear. Every now and then she has trouble with people hearing her, so we need to get it checked out. So far, mine has not had any issues."
5,"Went by phone on the counter and that was it.
Best phone Ive ever owned"
4,"Great display can see in daylight outdoors, smooth operation, camera takes crisp clear shots. 64 gb hard drive a plus. Text message sound is a bit quiet if around loud machinery."
3,"Switched from iPhone, and enjoying this phone. Fantastic camera quality"
5,"I waited to buy this phone, but after all the great reviews and it going on sale at Best Buy, I decided to go ahead. I went from an S4, which I still liked, to the S8 and am so happy I did. There are great new features, it's a nice looking phone, and it is so much faster than my old phone."
5,I needed to upgrade my old phone due to internal storage limitations and problems with Bluetooth failing. This phone has more than enough internal storage and allows for 256GB of external storage. My only issue with this phone is it doesn't allow moving data and apps from internal storage to external storage. I did find an app that allowed my to at least move my data.
5,Great phone. Fits the hand just right and large enough to see. The large memory is great. Takes time to get used to if you are switching from another OS. But great phone and camera too
5,I upgraded my Galaxy S6 to the S8. WOW is the best way to describe it. Great purchase!
5,love the easy and constraint well made fits well in hand.
5,really love s8. its a big step from my last Samsung phone well construed fits well in hand
5,The Galaxy S8 is a great all around phone. The large screen is gorgeous and the camera is fantastic!
5,I've bought Samsung phones now for a while and this one is really nice. Absolutely no issues.
5,So far this a great phone . It transferred all my data easily . I was impressed with this phone looks good and is the right size and weight.
5,"Fast phone. Large, bright screen but still easy to hold."
5,"This phone is amazing. The glass screen with side access is amazing, just be sure to put a protective cover on. The camera is amazing and Bixby is a lot of fun."
1,Again i got package from best buy samsung s8 but its defective one. I send back to at&t to claim nee one and waiting for new samsung galaxy s8
5,oh my gosh this phone is so much faster than my old one I have a lot more things to learn on this phone enjoying it.
5,This is by far the best Android phone out there. All features far exceed the other competitors out there. The only issue I wish they would fix/update is the bixby button. Make it programmable.
5,"Great phone. Very responsive, has all the features I need."
5,"I love the new operating system, I do enjoy the larger no button screen."
5,"I first bought the Galaxy S8 plus for my wife, and everyone liked it. When my daughter was ready to upgrade her phone, it became an easy decision, although she chose S8 for its smaller size."
5,"Great phone, user friendly.. great resoulution fast & efficient phone"
5,"Great phone, user friendly.. great resoulution fast & efficient phone"
5,The optical scanner is pretty neat. Didn't like that they took away the home button and moved the fingerprint scanner to the back but got used to it pretty quick. Love the water resistance
5,"Coming from my S6, battery life is amazing. Overall happy with my purchase"
3,I don't get notifications for some apps on my phone and my e mail isn't working properly
2,"I have always had Samsung phones, but I do not like very much about this one. When texting, I feel like I have 2 thumbs. I have to retype EVERY thing constantly.
I also feel like i will have to go to school to learn how to use it. 
It is constantly throwing up ""helpful"" hints to me. Annoying....."
4,"I like it,but too many changes in the Android 7 and the Galaxy 8 made just to make changes. The curved edges are a pain and many apps that worked well have been ""deproved"" that is changed with no or negative improvement"
5,"Upgraded from the S6. Great display, many new features. I love that they added back expandable memory."
5,Love the new Galaxy S8 phone. The slim phone is easy to handle and to carry in your pocket
5,Awesome phone! Upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Mega 2 and couldn't be happier. Graphics are great!
5,"So much better than an iphone--like the camera, wraparound screen etc."
5,This was a great buy for me I love the new Bixby app and the fact that this can get wet. I work around water a lot so this is an added benefit.
5,"I've been waiting to upgrade the s5 I've had for 3 years, this phone does not disappoint. Amazing video and pictures. Much better sound."
4,I bought this phone to replace a 3 year old android device that was on its way out. The s8 features are great and there are so many options to customise it to my liking. Would recommend to other android friendly people.
5,"Definitely an upgrade to my s6 edge in display, memory, and processor. Evidently noticed right away. Beautiful display, very responsive to touch. Still have to setup Bixby but so far, so good."
5,Great phone always reliable. I have owned a galaxy phone for 5 years.
4,Excellent phone with a smooth interface and great display. Edge screen features are more useful than I expected.
4,Excellent phone with a smooth interface and great display. Edge screen features are more useful than I epxected.
5,This is a great phone. I love the camera and the style.
5,"Fast, reliable, great screen. We have had Samsung for a while, great brand."
5,The single best phone on the market. Apple needs to step up fast!
5,"Love the new Samsung S8, beautiful display, looks awesome . Great deal 150 dollars off and a free wireless charger. Thank you Best Buy!!"
5,"Incredible camera/picture quality with a zoom that's crisp & clear. What really drove me to this phone though, was the way it felt in my hand... it just fits! I moved to this device from an S3 (I use my devices as long as they'll let me)"
5,The Galaxy S8+ is an incredible successor to the S7 line. Highly recommended.
4,This S8 is the best one yet. A little different interface and needs more documentation. Those who a familiar with Samsung are fine. Those Apple users who switch will eventually be happy
4,"Cons: the whites are not as good as my Honor 8. It's more of a warm white. (Yes I've adjusted it in the color settings). The phone is a little over contrasted in color. It's good for scenery photography, but sometimes my skin color looks more reddish. I wish Samsung would add contrast adjust in the settings.

Pros: everything else about the phone is amazing. The looks makes it's competitors look out of date. Battery is fairly good. Samsungs GUI is so good i dont need a 3rd party launcher. It is quick and the size is spot on."
5,Exceeded my expectations. Replaced a galaxy S4 which itself was a great phone. I have no reason to switch to the alternative.
4,"The only thing that I don't like is, now enclosed case from Lifeproof"
5,Great phone. Only thing I klmiss from my s6 is the ir blaster. Curved edge screen is great.
4,Much better than the last one. Easy to use. More storage space. Better overall.
4,"Like the display on this phone. 
Seamless wifi calling helps"
5,Saw my new Galaxy phone and had to have one just like it. She appreciates the call quality and battery life.
5,"Switched from the Galaxy S8+ and haven't looked back. Great screen resolution, snappy performance, and amazing battery life! Bixby Voice would be nice, but the Google Assistant does a decent job in the meantime."
1,We bought two of these. We were Samsung users from way back and were happy with their phones. This is an exception. They have changed many things but did not improve the user experience. they changed things that worked remarkably well to things that work sometimes or quirky We are very displeased. The new major update changed settings(although it said it would not) and put annoying reminders on top of reminders that I had working correctly before the update.
5,"Have only had it for a few weeks, but so far so great. the expandable memory and 64 gigs alone are definitely a bonus."
5,Got this phone from Best buy with ATT upgrade option .i had very good experice with best buy when buying phones
5,I've been with Samsung for a while now & I really needed an upgrade & couldn't wait for the Note 8. The S8 Plus is a good alternative!
5,"Love this phone and all the features on it. Fast, slim and great screen"
5,"This is, by far, the best mobile phone I have ever used."
5,"Best phone of 2017 , so far, great camera, battery ,all round device. Came from previous android devices, this by far is the most impressive."
5,Love it! This phone has so many nice features !! can't wait to see what they come up with next
5,"And I've had quite a few of them. I confess, I'm an early adopting tech geek. I'm still learning my way around the UI changes in the version 7 OS but I think they've done a good job with it. I'm particularly impressed with the way it teaches you about new features a bit at a time, as I you use the phone.

Performance is great. Much faster than my 5S and the display quality is killer."
5,The display is...awesome. I love this phone. Coming from an HTC One that I liked and this phone is light years ahead.
5,"It's so amazing. It is literally keeping my life together in one spot right now. The screen is so beautiful and large, camera takes great pics. A+"
5,"love my S8 it's a sleek device which has all the current tech in it, I require a powerful device not a child's toy and this android is by far the best in the lineup as of right now. Excellent battery life with expandable memory couldn't ask for more..."
5,Love everything about this phone. Traded in my old Galaxy for the newer one and expect it will lasts even longer than the 2 1/2 years of my old one.
5,"Indoor pics are awesome. Even in poor light. My old phone Galaxy S5 took poor indoor pics. I am still trying to learn all the features on the phone. I am able to get a phone signal in areas I could not before. Easier to hold, as is slimmer. Love this phone."
5,"My last two phones were Galaxy phones, and I continue to love them more each time. The Galaxy S8 is Great! I plan to stick with the Galaxy phones."
5,Best phone out on the market at this time. Samsung knew they had some making up to do.
5,"My wife loves this new phone, all features are genial."
4,Great screen size and light weight shape videos screen
5,"Overall the galaxy s8 is a beautiful phone. The infinity screen is by far the best display I've seen on a phone yet. The camera is amazing just like the s7 and the build quality of the phone is the best I've ever handled and the hardware runs nougat flawlessly. Id recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy it, you won't regret it"
4,"Thus far, I have been impressed. It shatters easily though if dropped. Price point is high, but competitive. Like the visual calling capability."
5,"I was not intending to purchase a new phone but when I found my old one was no longer being manufactured, I bought the S8. It has great features and practically runs itself. Still getting used to it but am quite content so far. Infinity screen is insane, too!"
5,"Upgraded from Samsung S4 to the S8. Absolutely love the new phone. Bigger screen size, longer battery life, faster processor. Haven't found anything I don't like about the new phone yet."
5,"Great phone
Easy to use
Great pics.
Fast charge, better than my old Apple."
5,I love this phone !!! Would highly recommend it went from iPhone 7 to this and it was a great decision .
5,"Compared to my Galaxy S7 edge, my Galaxy S8 has a way better battery life."
5,Great and latest android phone with lots of interesting features and capabilities. Love the VR reality settings and edge design.
5,"My wife replaced her Note 4 with this S8. The phone itself is great. Familiar menus and programming, great camera, and battery is performing 4 to 5 times better than the Note 4. It is only about a week old though, but if it continues to perform in this manner, a much improved phone this will be."
5,"This is my third Galaxy phone. It may be hard to imagine, but he screen and camera get better every time. I have had it about 2 weeks. No issues. Great battery life so far."
4,What a big difference from an S5 to an S8.!!! This S8 can easily give the IPhone a run for the money. The performance and speed are excellent. I can install up to 128gb SD card and never worry about space. The phone comes with 64gb so you have more than enough to start with. Glad I upgraded!!
5,I love my new Galaxy S8. The screen is amazingly sleek and curved. I love all the features and the fast speed.
5,"Love it, so clear as if you are right there, and so easy to manage."
5,Another great release from the folks at Samsung. Way to go!!
4,This phone is a huge step up from my old Lumina 1020 Windows phone. Call volume is great and clear. Screen looks awesome too.
5,The battery life is good and the performance is also better than older samsung phones
4,This phone is super fast and user friendly. I love the look.of the curved screen but trying to keep it protected is not the best.
4,This is a great phone and chase awesome features. The only draw back is with the curved screen and available glass screen protectors for it. But it's an awesome phone for sure!
5,Camera is great. Sound quality is good. Chockful of features.
5,"Love the orchid gray color. Pictures don't do it justice. Phone itself is greaf, there's still a bit of the Samsung stutter here and there but the extra features make the trade of worth it."
5,My husband loves it. It takes great photos is easy and fun to use
5,The phone works great. The only downside is if you are an existing AT&T customer you should go to a authorized retail store to activate it. Do not try to use the self activation kit.
4,Overall I love this phone. Takes fantastic pictures. Battery life is better than previous models. Only complaint is that I'm not a fan of the curved screen especially with a protective case.
5,Sound quality is good. Fits well in my hand and love the look.
5,Extremely fast and user friendly. Wireless charging is a huge plus.
5,Purchased for my son. He loves all the features and how easy it is to use.
5,"I went from an S5 to the S8 and I am a happy camper. Battery life, screen sharpness, and raw power are all greatly improved from past galaxy phones."
5,This is by far the best Android phone I've ever used and I've used a ton of them. It's fast with great battery life and a simply stunning display. I couldn't be more satisfied and Samsung seems to be doing a much better job in releasing updates as well.
4,I'm not a huge fan of the curved edges but the phone is fast and the battery lasts foreverrrrr!
5,"I love this phone, can't wait to figure out all the stuff it does, I upgraded from a S4 so am very excited about all the new features on this phone"
5,"love love love this phone,upgraded from S4 and am really happy with this phone"
5,"Bought for my wife, she had the S7 witch we gave to our son. Both parties are very happy!"
5,"The call quality is markedly better than with my Galaxy s5, as is the camera and the speed. With 64 GB of space I will probably never run out, which has been a challenge in the past. The phone is sleek and the display crisp. I love it!"
4,"Coming from an Iphone there is a small learning curve. Works great, plenty of apps, looks great and feels great too."
5,I upgraded from a Samsung S6 to a S8. I love everything about it. The new size is perfect for me. I love the curved edges the best. I think the new OS is great as well. I live on a lake so the water 'proof/resistant' feature is a big plus for me.
5,This phone does it all from app availability to screen and picture quality. Plenty of storage and long battery life.
5,I really like my phone. Still learning how to work all of the features.Great camera.
5,Had a Samsung 4 before and this is quite a change. Camera is great and with a little patience I am able to get into the phone more. Best Buy is really great in providing any assistance when I ask for it.
5,"This is another great phone from Samsung. I was very impressed with battery life, Camera performance, storage options, USB C port etc.
I was waiting for long time to replace my S5 with great phone and S8 fulfilled all the features i am looking for."

5,"A very nice phone, takes great pictures, Glad to have it."
5,"Everything about the galaxy s8 is superb. Really nice screen, really responsive, sleek, and functional. I came from an LG G4 and the battery life is what has shown me it's true upper hand; I went from 3 replaceable batteries a day to charging every other night!"
5,"I have owned the original galaxy S, S 2, S3, and the S6 active. This phone feels high quality. I always did not understand why Samsung phones had to feel so plasticy compared to Iphones. This phone feels high class in your hands. Its runs great."
5,"The sound out of the speaker is crisp and clear, camera is great, overall it's a very good phone."
5,"Excellent product. Gets the job done! The color options are different, it's faster, has a better camera, and best buy even helped us to install the glass screen protector"
5,Easy to set up and connect to. Fast wireless speed at a very reasonable price. I've got a 1 story house with a finished basement. Perfect reception everywhere in the house. Can even connect in my yard.
5,"I like the look, how fast it is, the display, the touch screen is very sensitive, all around very good phone."
5,"is ok but the sound is not the best, samsung s6 had and still has the best sound versus s7 and s8 ,why?water protection...but i would recommend and i will buy this samsung s8"
5,We bought this on the buy one get one. Truly the best deal I've ever had when purchasing a cell phone. Came with a wireless charger and a $100 BB gift card! My wife got the same. We are extremely happy.
5,"I'm in love with my new Samsung Galaxy S8. It's got a beautiful, large screen. Still waiting for my auto-correct to get to know me though - seems worse than my previous galaxy."
5,My husband loves this phone and he is happy he went with the smaller screen.
5,Best looking phone around right now. Super easy to use!
5,Easy to use and navigate would recommend to anyone!

5,"Very user friendly, great camera and battery life. The camera quality is up there with my dslr camera"
5,"Its still early but, the phone seems to be a really good product."
5,"It's Samsung's Flagship phone. It's expected to be top of the line in all categories and it pretty much is. Incredible screen, super fast, excellent camera, etc. Some have complained about the placement of the fingerprint reader, but you can get used to its position and unlock the phone quickly. Iris scanner works quickly too."
5,Amazing graphics but it's super long it would be better if it was like the s7
4,Expected the phone to do more. Great phone all around tho
5,This cell is wonderful. Pictures and fitness app is great.

5,"May seem like just another phone, but it's not. Extremely quick and beautiful display."
5,"So far, the S8 has been a refreshing new item from the Samsung line of products."
5,"It took me 5 years to update my phone. I had the S3, was not interested learning a new phone but I love it. The only thing is that keyboard and icons are hard to push because of the glass hd screen protector."
5,Pictures are wonderful. But don't but the glass hd screen protector. It makes it very hard to push the buttons.
5,"My husband loves his new Samsung galaxy S8! The silver color is nice looking adding to the attractiveness of this sleek body. His prior cell phone was the S5
 The S8 has 75% more memory than the S5. Not having enough memory in the S5 was a major issue for him!"
5,So happy to finally have a new phone. So far - I just love it
4,Daughter loves it the phone and gets the same onebbbbbbbbbbbbb
5,Everything I expected and more. I love all the new features. It's kind of inconvenient that the charger changed from the micro usb.
5,I recently purchased this as a replacement to my IPhone 5C replacement. Works great and have great futures.

5,"I have had Galaxy phones since the S3 came out, and I can honestly say that the S8 is the best version yet!

5,Best phone ever. Dose everything I expected and more. Lightning fast
5,"I love my new phone can do a lots of new things, The camera
is great. Samsung Galaxy S 8."
5,The no button home button is great. It is the main reason I wanted to upgrade.
3,"After one week seems like a good and intuitive phone so far but, has been difficult to adapt to as a lifelong iphone user. Seems slightly awkward to perform simple tasks."
5,She upgraded to this one and loves it. Screen clarity and feel are awesome. Extra memory should come in handy.
5,She really likes the Samsung phone and opted for it over a new iPhone
5,"Love the s8, great camera good battery. Light weight"
5,This is a great phone with a long lasting battery!
5,What an amazing phone. Great battery life. Wireless charging is awesome.

4,"The phone is great. Loving the screen for its vivid colors and clarity, beyond amazing pictures most of all and the battery last me up to 2 days with lots of texting, internet browsing etc. 4 stars because I have a problem with hearing people or me cutting off to people. Didnt have that problem with iphone at all and had the same service provider for both phones so maybe has to do with the galaxys s8 antenna. Other than that i love every single thing about the phone. I can deal with the one problem because it doesn't happen every time."
5,Love the fingerprint scanner. Battery life is excellent. Lasts all day without a charge. The screen resolution is outstanding.
5,Great phone love the screen so clear and the camera is amazing. Even some of my iPhone friends were amazed about it
5,Great step up would definitely recommend to a friend
4,I was treated very well in the store and was givin options before I purchased the Samsung phone. I would recommend Best Buy to my friends.
5,"I love my 8+, it has the best features, it looks awesome and the battery life is a beast."
5,This is by far the best android phone on the market right now. Excellent product and beautiful design.
5,The display is excellent. Very responsive. Very easy to transfer everything from your old phone. An adapter and cable are included to do this.
5,Switched from I phone to android and so far a good switch
5,Happy with purchase. Recommend to everyone. Loyal to Samsung brand
5,I have owned just about every Samsung phone and this is my favorite.
5,Fastest device I have ever used. Only had for 2 weeks. A lot to learn with his device. A lot of very usefull apps. Bixby is a great asset and very keen on what is going on with you.
5,Love the expandable memory and picture quality. Curvature of the screen offers more viewing space
5,I was a long time apple guy until this beautiful phone came out tooo many features to go over .. a must have phone
5,I was a long time apple guy until this beautiful phone came out tooo many features to go over .. a must have phone
5,Best device on the market! I would definitely recommend to a friend.. great screen size and camera
5,"I has passed on the S6 and S7, so my S5 was definitely showing it's age. This phone rocks. Got it with the included Gear VR, and this phone can handle the processing power required for a smooth VR experience. Other than that, it's a Samsung, so you probably already know what you're getting. Unless you need to stick with the kiddie ecosystem of Apple, just get this phone."
5,The phone is one of the best on the market and is great
5,I always had an apple phone so this one was something different I am still learning
5,Coming from a Galaxy S5 this phone is a big upgrade. Doesn't seem to overheat like the 5 did. Only issued are that Bixby isn't fully functional yet and the fingerprint sensor stops working and has to be reset.
5,Purchased this s8 for my brother. He has had no problems with it yet
5,Purchased this phone for my mother. She loves it and has no complaints.
4,Always liked android more than Apple. Switched to an LG g4 after the s5 but bad to send it back because of a defect. Went back to samsung.
4,phone is pretty sweet good graphics and the camera is great
5,"I absolutely love the phone, went from a slightly older model in tge s6 edge up to the galaxy 8. The difference is amazing."
5,"This is one of the best phones I have ever had, I always have always loved Samsung phones and will continue to stick to the Galaxys."
5,Went from an S5 to the S8 and everything to runs so much faster. There is an issue with the glass screen protectors but that in no-fault of the phone its self.
5,Went from an S5 to the S8 and everything to runs so much faster. There is an issue with the glass screen protectors but that in no-fault of the phone its self.
5,"I switched from the iphone 6 to this Samsung Galaxy 8 and am very happy with the phone. The screen is vibrant and I like the curved look to it. Haven't had any issues with getting set up, getting applications installed. Still getting used to using the Android but so far loving it!!"
5,I just upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S8...happy customer!
4,"So far I like the phone, but there is a lot to learn to fully get the most from the phone."
4,So far I like this product but there is a lot to learn.
4,"Nice phone, little confusing for older adults who are not used to computerized phones."
5,My wife upgraded this from a Galaxy S5 and the screen is awesome.
5,I like it.... that's why i bought it..............
4,I have always been pleased with my Samsung phones. Would like to be able to send more than 1 or 2 pictures in a single text message.
5,I was an avid iphone user now Im switched to samsung love it
5,Best screen i have ever seen on a phone. Fast. Decent battery life
5,"Awesome product! Beautifully crafted, amazing design!"
5,Decided to finally upgrade from S5. Made a good choice.
5,As a non-techie person I found navigating through the apps and setting up WiFi and Bluetooth settings great size not too small and big enough to photos clearly.
3,After being a long time iPhone user I decided to break out of my mold. I had the S8 for under two weeks but noticed that I had voicemails with no missed calls and poor call quality. This was in comparison to my almost 3 year old iPhone. When I called the carrier to see if it could be an issue with the new phone I was told that the iPhone had a larger antenna and that there was an update forthcoming to correct a call quality issue. Well needless to say with less than a day left to bail out I decided to go back to my old phone as I used it primarily as a phone. Hard to believe the difference between the two but it was a clear differentiation. I loved the features of the S8 but not it's ability as a phone.
5,I've only had the S8 for a week but I really like it so far. I just upgraded from a S5 so it has taken me a little to get use to it with the change. Camera is much nicer!
4,"I had a S6 for the last 2 years and figured it was time for an upgrade. So far, I'm happy with my choice. I don't really care about the curved screen, but I don't dislike it. I hate the dedicated Bixby button and wish that it could be reprogrammed without having to download a third-party app."
5,"S8 hardware is a beauty, gorgeous display, almost no bezel."
5,"This new phone lives up to the great reviews. It has a sleek design, and I love the different ways you can unlock it. Facial recognition is very cool."
5,This phone is awesome. Easy to use and a lot like the other Samsung product....
5,This phone is durable and the battery life is SO much better than previous versions of the Galaxy. Maybe Samsung finally figured it out.
4,Happy with the phone but having a hard time with the visual vm. Y wah you could just call your vm but visual vm is convenient. Otherwise really like the pho e.
4,Really love a water proof phone.It was handy when it was raining
5,will buy the phone again. whis the phone came in white
3,the screen got freeze after 2 days of use and restart it self every 5 minutes
5,"This is my 3rd Samsung Galaxy and each one has been better than the one before. I got the 8 and my husband got the 8+, other than size they seem to be the same. The Iris scanner is fantastic, no more fumbling with fingerprints, just swipe the screen, look at the phone and it's unlocked. (If you liked the fingerprint scanner then this upgrade may not be for you, they moved the touch sensor to the back - right next to the rear camera - and it's really hard to register each fingerprint and nearly impossible to scan one with a case on the phone.)"
5,This phone has been great so far I have not had any issues.
5,"I had a Note 4 before (much larger) and wanted a phone that would fit into my pocket, thus the S8. Now I wish I had gotten the S8+ as it is still more narrow than the Note 4. But I am happy with the S8 - it is a great phone - still finding out all the cool features."
4,"It's a fast, responsive device. It looks and feels sleek and is quite thin and light. I wish the battery was replaceable. It's also a bit slippery. I wish the back was somewhat textured. Know that it uses USB-C connector, so I ended up also getting a few new cables to replace my SUB mini cables."
5,"I wrote a review of the S8+, I bought both... I prefer the size of S8 over the plus. Excellent camera, screen, better life, everything. Did I mention the screen? There is nothing I can complain about with this device. Honestly the fingerprint sensor is way better than what a lot of people are saying in reviews, but I also have larger hands. If you're not tht kind of person who has to choose between a phone and putting food on your table, buy this."
5,So far I have 0 complaints. This phone is awesome. Very smooth. Fast. Great pictures.
4,"I don't usually like getting a new phone, because it takes days to get everything figured out. This has been overall pretty easy, I've had to go to Youtube a time or two for some minor features, but all the normal use functions are easy to use."
5,Upgraded from S5 and there is such a difference in everything.
2,Very disappointed with Best Buy. Enroll for a training and got their and it was cancel. No one called me or emailed me about the cancellation. Someone at the store help me but I'm still having problems with my phone. Can't delete email. I do and it comes back on again. My husband sometimes gets an emergency note. Classes are schedule to early that I cant make it.
5,"Hated to get a new phone but Samsung made it easy with the included sync cable that allows you to transfer everything that you want from the old phone to the new one. Love the feel of the S8, still learning all the features but the camera is excellent and the battery life is great - so far!"
5,"My wife and I both upgraded our phone recently, mine from a Galaxy 5S Active, to a Galaxy 8+, and my wife from an I phone 5 to the Galaxy 8. She debated for quite awhile about switching, but now that she has, she is very glad she did."
4,Fairly new to the Samsung products so it's some getting used to. However I am feeling better about the device as I become more comfortable everyday.
4,Still getting used to changes from Galaxy 6 but very cool.
5,The best resolution ever! Can't stop looking at it!
5,"Great camera, it takes the best pictures I've ever seen with a phone. Easy set up when I got it. Highly recommended."
5,"I love the S8 Galaxy, its a great phone and holds charge for a long time. My only issue is the bixby side button. Other than that it is awesome."
5,I am happy with the purchase. Great phone!! I just wonder how people could buy Iphones instead of Galaxy s phones.
5,"This phone is sleek, easy to use, and has it all. My wife loves it."
5,Has everything a beginner needs to get all the fun and necessity out of a mobile device
5,The display on the S8 is very impressive. Response time is crazy fast when downloading video files. Images taken with the rear camera have amazing detail.
4,So I purchased this phone for my wife and took it home and was immediately having issues when the phone was established on home Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi would turn off on its own if the screen was locked and have to be manually turned on. Took the phone to AT&T to discover the phone had malware. I went to return the device to best buy and the manager was rude and kept interrupting me when I was explaining the situation and refused to Return the device and told me I had to go to the original purchase store. He stated if he took it back he would have to have geek squad look at it but then refused to have them look at it. Device was returned at original store with no issues. End result is phone had an issue and i got it fixed. Rude managers don't help situations.
5,"Very happy with this smart phone. Had an iPhone 6 before, so there was a little bit of a learning curve, but the features are easy to use."
5,It is a unique phone as compared to other phones in the market
5,I would refer this phone to anyone looking for high quality and dependable support.
5,"This is my first phone that is not an iPhone. I have only had the phone for 2 weeks but I have been very happy so far. The screen on the phone is very impressive. The fingerprint sensor on the back takes a little getting used to, but overall a very nice phone."
5,The speed of this phone is amazing! The storage is monumental and expandable. The best upgrade ever. Nothing else can touch it.
5,I have been a Samsung phone user a while and this phone is Great.
5,I like this phone much better than my Samsung galaxy S4
5,"I upgraded from the S5 to the S8. It isn't much heavier then the S5. Videos and graphics are great. Haven't tried ""Bigsby"" yet, but the phone stands on its own without this feature."
5,"The color is wonderful, though that's not the point. I love everything about the phone the only things I'd like to mention is that since there is no actual home button, when t he phone freezes it goes haywire on a minimal scale. I don't really use Bixby, he's kind of...unnecesary to me. But then I only use this phone on an average scale. I upgrade from the Samsung S3 so the layout and mechanics are definitely different. Other than that, I've only had a few weeks to actually make a judgement on it so I'll update if anything happens."
5,"It's a bit slim, but you get used to it. I had the Samsung S3 until I recently upgraded, so the way things work on this phone is much different. It just takes time getting used to it. I really like this side window option that's given. Honestly, I only use my phone for everyday usage, nothing fancy. Ok, things I've noticed: 
*when using the phone for too long it freezes (what phone doesnt) but because of the lack of a physical home button, it goes kinda crazy. I just push the lock screen and wait a moment. Some apps are missing it's simple features. I have a study app with a bookmark feature where you can select the paragraph and bookmark it...simple,yes, but this phone doenst do that. My gmail also doesn't open up my whole mail, and it's hard to explain but, it's missing something. I know these are app issues, but still, just wanted to let you know."
5,"I've had Galaxy phone since the original S so I'm fairly familiar with them. This is by far the best one I've ever had. Much faster and better build than my previous s5, and the battery life is a massive improvement."
5,"I love Samsung products, but this one is one of the best. The screen is flawless and the size is just right."
4,"The S8 is a great phone but the glass cover is fragile, 1 phone was dropped the first night and the lower right glass cover fractured, definitely recommenced insurance and a protective cover before leaving the store!!"
5,"My S4 went for a swim. I had been reviewing the S8 for an upgrade for awhile. I was pleased with the ability to retrieve all my info from my old phone, including messages, screen settings, etc. It is a big change for me, but I'm finding it easy to navigate."
5,"Overall this is a great phone. I have not had any problems yet. I understand complaints about the awkward placement of the fingerprint scanner, but it has not really been a problem for me, especially when you use the iris scanner. I came from the S6, and the S8 is much snappier/faster, and my battery lasts the whole day easy now."
5,I have to say this is one of the best and beautiful phones I ever had.
5,Nice size and easy to handle. A big upgrade from my S5
4,"I'm happy, though not with the beveled edges. They don't seem to make a glass screen protector for these phones that stay on. I love the new Type C USB connector, though it will take a while to rid ourselves of all the old devices with the Usb minis."
5,Works great and has amazing picture quality and features.
5,"I absolutely love this phone! I was always and android user, decided to try apple...just couldnt get it. Tried this new s8, wow! Totally in love. Everything ive always wanted and more. Great, screen, graphics, memory ,programs and processes."
5,"Overall great phone, hope the battery last,the camera is great."
5,"As expected from Samsung's flagship phone. It is well built and the specs get the job done. Originally did not like the idea of a the curved edge on both sides, but warming up to it. The objection was over having a case that could adequately protect those curves and still be functional, and having a screen protector that would not get in the way. It was decided that I would forgo the screen protector as many reviews stated that there was issues using the edges. I hope that the Otterbox case can properly protect the screen, but I guess that is what accidental protections plans are for."
5,works with otterbox cover so no need to take cover Off to charge
5,This phone much smoother than the Galaxy 6. Some of the same problems that I had with Galaxy 6 I don't have any more with Galaxy 8.I love this phone
4,Takes a little getting use to but the finger print scanner is the biggest downfall
4,Needed to replace my Samsung S4 so this was a great option. Still learning how to use it =/
5,Upgraded from Galaxy S5 to new S8 and love it! Great phone! Samsung didn't disappoint.
5,Great phone and great camera. Like the expandable memory
4,The phone is amazing. It looks great and performs really well. I was a little worried to move to a Samsung phone because I always hear about all the bloatware added to the phones and there is some but I do find most of the software useful.
5,"This is a very nice phone, with everything that is needed. I only wish I would have purchased the larger model, S8+"
5,"I love this phone! It is smaller than my last phone, but powerful. I also really like the new Bixby feature."
5,I really love the phone is amaxing. I do recommend it
5,"Camera and Bixby are excellent.
Fingerprint sensor might be little difficult to use."
5,"I love how easily customizable this phone is. The theme shop has cute themes and icons. The duel edge design looks nice, and Samsungs are really easy to use. Screenshot gestures and camera gestures are a bonus."
5,can really tell a difference with the new screen ...
5,"Nice size to grip(compair S7edge). fast reponse, touch feel. one thing finger print sensor on back."
5,I like size of new galaxy s8. more comfortable grip.
5,I went from an S5 to an S8 & it was like going from a flip phone to a smart one. I am still learning about all the features. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the fact that the battery will last a whole day w/o needing a recharge - even when it's being used. Love the new cameras too.
5,"Great phone, love screen size and easy to use the Internet."
4,Product's screen shape does not very well accommodate the attachment of a screen saver.
5,"I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S8 having previously owned a Galaxy S6 Edge so I have used some of the features Samsung has provided the past couple years. The difference on this phone is I am using more of those features than I did before. The fingerprint option is better now with the reader being on the back. My hand is usually holding it right there anyway so that helps me to keep from entering the code every time. Although I have tried the facial recognition, I prefer not to use it and it just doesn't seem as secure or reliable as the PIN or fingerprint. 

A couple of other nice features is the ability to sync my Google accounts with mail, photos, drive etc. I have not yet used the Bixby feature but it seems like it is capable of learning your habits and providing you with customized content that would be beneficial. I plan to give that a try. Samsung Pay is so easy on this phone and I am using it now as well. One last option I will mention is when I updated to this phone I brought over my most used apps and they seem to run better on this phone and the battery life is way better than the S6. I leave location on most of the time now and my battery keeps its charge much better. 

Jordan B at the Best Best Mobile in Norman, Oklahoma's Sooner Mall was very knowledgeable about the products as well as the options available. He gave me all the available promotions including a Fast Charge Wireless Charger and a $100 gift card. I appreciate his help in deciding what accessories to purchase for this phone and the iPhone my wife decided to buy. Also, Jordan helped us get set up in our new phones by transferring from our old phones right in the store."
5,Hoping for a Miracle. My wife breaks the phone no matter what. This time I added the insurance protection as well
5,"I bought this phone a few weeks ago which is amazing but the experience was not a great one. I had to give up my phone number (which corporate told me was unnecessary and I would have to spend $50 to change back), was not given the details of the AT&T plan which included me having to buy Direct Tv in order to use the HBO Package which I had been promised was not the case and then corporate said was a lie. The experience in purchasing from a representative was not entirely great but the phone and deal in buying the phone was and is great."
5,"Like playing my games on the bigger screen, makes game more fun"
5,"Really love the bigger screen. Almost didn't update from my S5. Didn't think there would be that much difference between the screens, but there is. Also like the rapid picture taking ability, almost like a pro!"
5,"Great phone, beautiful screen, fast processor, sleek design. Way overpriced, though."
4,"....not such a leap from the S-6. And they took out the tv remote hardware.
Bummer. But enjoying the phone and its features anyway."
5,It's extremely useful and there's a lot of hidden things you can do with this phone. The camera on this thing is amazing!
5,I finally upgraded from my Note 3. Wow!! Love the camera and features! So far so good!
5,"Just purchased a new galaxy S8. A family member has the S7 and they are both excellent devices. Long battery life, expandable memory, great screen. Best Buy often offers promos on these devices ."
5,Great device. Love the features and phone. Only drawback is the edges are curved and hard to protect from a fall
5,I upgraded from an S4 to an S8. Still getting use to the new phone. Only minor cons (to me) is the length (longer than the S4) and can't remove battery (my S4 went swimming a few times lol). Other than that....i love it!
5,This is the best phone I've ever had. Went from a s6 to an s8. Way better than iphone
4,"This is my first android experience. The S8 is a beautiful device. It's fast and fluid. After a two weeks, I noticed some performance stuttering in vr and hi end games. I contacted Samsung and shipped my phone. I'm waiting for it to come back."
4,"I really like this phone. I haven't tried Bixby yet. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the curved screen. Sometimes it doesn't read your touch unless you're touching the perfect spot. I had the S5, so the camera is amazing compared to my old phone."
5,Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Very good form factor, good battery life, fast performance. Comes with 64gb storage with expandable storage."
4,Im liking the phone so far. Ben was a great help too
5,This is a awesome phone does everything I need and more! Me and my wife love them!
5,This is a awesome phone does everything I need and more! Me and my wife love them!
5,"My colleagues who are mostly iPhone fans had to admin that Galaxy 8 is a better looking phone than iPhone now. I am very impressed with the quality of cameras. I also like the ""edge"" features."
5,I am new to the droid world but like this phone. Somewhat of a learning curb but I am getting there.
5,"Phones seem to always kick the bucket before your ready for it. However, so far this phone has been great. The battery life is amazing. And the new screen is pretty cool."
5,"This phone is smarter than me! Has great memory, awesome pictures and love infinity screen"
5,This phone is the cats meow it's the bees knees!!!
5,Stayed with the same phone works well for me no problems.
5,"Great HD display, fast loading for all apps, gorgeous design"
5,"I use to be iPhone user and i switched to Samsung. Very nice design and fast, lost of memory and good for multitasking."
5,What can I say....i all around love this phone. It's lightning fast too!
5,"Very fast compared to my last phone, light weight, veryg bright and vibrant screen...still learnijng everythiing it can do."
5,"Camera is amazing, storage capacity is endless, sending abilities are quick and easy."
5,"The best Samsung phone to date, but I still think the curved glass is gimmicky."
5,The Samsung 8 is meeting the expectations I had for it when I purchased it. I'm still learning about all of its features. The sound is good and clear and it is very responsive.
5,The galaxy s8 is a great phone with even better features!
5,This is an awesome phone. Everything works fine. And it has a big screen in a small phone
1,"I reviewed the S8 prior to purchase and it was all positive must mostly due to operating systems and compatibility. Nothing at the time talked about the poor screen craftsmanship. The phone slipped out of my pocket as I was lying on the ground, working on a vehicle. The phone was in a wallet case. The fall from a few inches cracked the screen and damaged the LCD. My last three phones have been Samsung Galaxy's. The repair will be near 300.00, when the parts are available. I was not offered a protection plan, if it was presented the salesman pushed through it, while talking to another salesman about photography. May have to switch back to Apple."
5,"Where do I start?? Honestly this phone has so many things about it that I love. The always on display, Bixby button, many cool customizable features, and just a gorgeous display, and I am still learning new things it does every day. Thank you to Stephanie, Mario, and Blake in the Forsyth location...you are all so great to help!"
5,"From the infinity screen to the incredible camera, tbis devoce is the cat's pajamas!"
5,This phone has a great camera and very easy to use
5,looks great n the performance is pretty good so complains
5,I upgraded from My S5 active. It's got more options and I'll ever use. Takes great pics and hd video.
4,"Coming from an S4, it doesn't feel entirely different but it is quicker/more responsive. Camera and audio quality are leaps aheads of the S4. Unfortunately still a bit of menu diving for functions vs the iPhone."
2,"Upgraded from Galaxy S5 to S8. Owned the S5 for over 3 years and it had only general wear and tear, but no major scratches or cracks even without ever using a case and taking some major spills. S8 back is made of glass. First crack/scratch showed up within a week and I'm not sure how it even got there. At the 2.5 week mark, the phone fell out of my waist pocket and the back broke/cracked significantly. I am still waiting on my case to show up from Samsung Promotions otherwise I would have covered it up already.

Second major gripe is that Fitbit is incompatible with this phone due to Bluetooth 5.0. I have a Blaze that is less than a year old. I was having all kinds of crazy BT problems with the phone: car audio streaming would skip like a CD player, Blaze battery would drain at 2 to3x the original original speed, Blaze unable to connect to phone for notification and GPS, and BT headset would keep cutting out. After removing the Fitbit app from my phone, all those problems went away. Worked the issue with both Samsung and Fitbit support, but it turned into a finger pointing battle. I guess Samsung's strategy paid off because I had to go out and buy a Gear Fit 2, just to have something that would work."
5,I bought this phone because the graphics were amazing. I love the high definition colors and it's fun and easy to use.
4,The home button d oesnt always work. I have t o touch multiple times to get the phone t o open up. Besides that the phone is great.
5,This phone is a nice phone on the android platform. If you do not like iPhone this is a great alternative.
5,"Overall best phone out 
Camera is awesome
Speaker is superior"
5,"Amazing phone. Battery life is great, the customization is limitless. the edge screen is also very cool. I love this phone"
5,I've never owned a phone as nice and sleek as this one. The display is unmatchable and is really snappy! The amoled on the screen really makes things pop!
5,"I am an iPhone fanboy...I would have never seen myself buying anything other than an iPhone until Samsung launched the S8. This is the perfect sice for me, S8 Plus a bit too big for one handed use even though I have large hands. I am 6'4"""
5,"I have been a long time Iphone user. adjusting to this phone is pretty easy and it does some things my Iphone could not do, like allowing text messagin on my car speakers while im driving."
5,"I upgraded from a Moto X, and I was a little bummed to find out that AT&T doesn't offer contracts with the newer Moto models. But so far I'm enjoying my Galaxy 8 even more than my old Moto X. It has a pretty good battery life, it's very easy to customize, and the slim design is great for small hands."
5,Love the look and speed to which it responds. Camera by far the best I've seen on a phone. One week and still learning and adding apps.
4,This is a great phone. Not too big and easy to use.
5,I'm liking this phone so far. I'm used to the galaxy's. There are many new things since the last one I had but this is really fun. Love the 64 GB!
5,"I like it. good phone not too big, not too small. clear glass, feels good to hold."
5,This phone is the best android phone I have ever purchased.
5,"Five stars A+++++, very sophisticated and high tech"
5,Transition from lg g3 was akward. Starting to discover some cool features and glad I finally switched over.
5,I went from an S5 to the S8 and I have been VERY impressed with the changes Samsung has made. The new infinity screen is amazing and the newer size is perfect too. I love the new camera with the Bixby feature and even with the zoom the picture quality is perfect.
5,Enhanced features and good product with all the updated.
5,"As soon as the salesman showed me the Samsung S8, it was a sale happening. I'm still learning about it's features, but it's so easy to get help at Best Buy for any questions. Thanks!"
5,nice phone. what you expect from samsung. cant go wrong with a galaxy.
5,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to the S8. My S5 filled up to a point where I would have to delete apps just to update. Hopefully with this storage I won't have the same problem. Love everything about the phone. My only gripe is with a glass screen protector. By adding this, I lost the sensitivity of the screen. I'm adapting but maybe an update will come out to fix the issue by allowing you to increase sensitivity."
5,"Best phone yet. Great battery life, much better than the S7 edge, overall beautiful phone."
4,"As a long time HTC user, I was sad to see that ATT stopped carrying them. I did a lot of research leading up to my next phone upgrade; looking into purchasing an unlocked HTC, switching to Google Pixel, or just caving and staying on my same plan and getting the Samsung Galaxy S8. 
I'm still learning then new tweaks between my old HTC and this new S8, but so far, so good. I purchased it online and picked it up in store. I set up and activated the phone on my own and transferred the info from my old HTC to my new S8. I'm pretty tech savvy, but it felt like even somebody less comfortable in their tech skills could easily do these steps. I am admiring the S8's camera and display, but I'm still getting used to the feel of it in my hand. I'm going to need a decent case with some good grip because it feels too tall and slick for me to hold confidently.
All in all, I'm happy with my purchase!"
5,"speed, graphics, camera, memory everything amazing"
4,haven't had any problems yet with this phone but it took 2 trips to activate it
4,"I purchased this phone to replace a S5 Active and so far it is what was advertised. Very fast, great camera front and back. Charges very fast and the battery life is excellent. Need this phone in the Active category so no extra case would be needed."
3,Good phone loose data and battery drains quick still happy operate good nothing much said about the phone to be bad just battery life
5,"Bought this for my wife, while I own the S8+ for my extra use for movies and gaming and. This size is great for normal use and more. The camera and picture quality is the same as the S8+, but minus the screen size difference."
5,"still learning how to use this phone since I am used to Nokia, but very nice phone so far!"
5,If you read my review for the galaxy s8+ than you'll know exactly what i mean.
4,"Upgraded from an s6. Not much has changed other than the display, no buttons, and it is faster (as to be expected)"
4,"My daughter loves her new phone! I would've given 5 stars, but we've only had them for a week, so we'll see how it goes!"
5,Absolutely love the camera on this phone the clarity is excellent.
5,In love wiht this new phone. Started off with the S8 it was too small and narrow for me so I went back in a week to upgrade to the S8+. Screen is big and not hard to hold and features are fantastic! Highly recommend this phone!
5,Great screen size and features. I upgraded from an S5 and what a difference a few years makes in technology. Now if I can only find a curved screen shield that works without bubbles I will be a happy camper
5,"i love the camera on this phone, it has a clean screen and it is very sleek."
5,"My fiancé had the s7 and I wanted to get him a new phone since he was complaining about it so I preordered him the 8 the only think he doesn't like is the curved screen he says it'll break easily but we'll see, overall he loves it"
5,"I went from an S4 to the S8 because I felt this product was for me. I kept my S4 for so long that I felt it was all I needed. Well, I was wrong. I use it for everything. The S8 camera is so much more defined. The S8 is in all the best thing I could have down for myself."
5,Love the new S8. I unfortunately missed out on my VR equipment thought :(
5,It is the perfect size! So glad that I decided to buy it.
5,"Bought a Moto x Pure less than a year ago, Bluetooth stopped working and this was an unlocked phone, I don't change phones often, I use them more for business, I have owned Samsung in the past , this phone did not disappoint, for a phone takes nice pictures, edge to edge display is cool"
4,"Pros:
Love the infinity screen - however the Galaxy cases do injustice to the edges
64GB in the base version 
Minimal clutter of apps
Fast charging 
Cons:
Battery time not impressive"
5,"After owning an S4 it is notable the difference in size, screen, speed of the S8."
5,"I am very happy with my S8. It is an upgrade from the S4 that I had and features, speed, convenience are outstanding"
5,"I previously owned the galaxy s6. By far beats it by a long shot with speed, performance, and pic capabilities."
4,I upgraded from the Galaxy S7 and I really like it! I wish they had Lifeproof cases for this phone though.
5,I loved the phone. It does have some extra features compared to my S5.
4,Display screen is amazingly beautiful and so is the user interface.
4,Most everything runs smoothly but while recording in 4K video the phone get really hot really quick. overall it's a great phone although I'm not crazy about the curved glass. The curve makes for some limited options when shopping for a case friendly glass screen protector. I still wish they offered a flat version because like I said I'm not crazy over the curved edge display. It's still worth buying though
5,The phone is a superb device all-around. Nothing comes close to the S8!
5,Bought this for my wife to replace her S5. She commented how much better her photos look when compaired to her older phone.
5,Enjoy movies in miniature and stay in touch on the go with this phone. Capture photos and HD videos with the device's dual 12 MP rear camera setup and use its advanced 8 MP front-facing camera for compelling selfie action. This phone stays secure thanks to its rear fingerprint scanner and sophisticated facial recognition technology. Stole this... Cause it's true.
5,Can't go wrong. I feel like this phone is the most stable phone and feels like the samsung has come up with the finalized product.
5,"Got my wife the galaxy s8 and she loves it, got my self the s8+, we upgraded form galaxy s6 and s6+, galaxy edge is the way to go."
5,Great display!!! This phone is awesome. You should buy it.
3,Change the key board to Google to make it work. Bixby what it does is beyond me don't seem to work. Operations seem fairly fast. Battery is good.
5,My phone has the best camera I take all kind of pics
5,"Like the bigger phone screen, function are better."
5,The design is great and really a delight to have fromy galaxy s 5
5,"Samsung has done an excellent job with the new Galaxy S8. Clear screen, excellent connectivity, and very easy to use."
5,"Other than the stupid button that activates Bixby, which is apparently a redundant virtual assistant, it's been a pretty nice phone. The voice to text isn't as good as iPhone though."
5,I am highly satisfied with my purchase. Will recommend to others.
5,My new Galaxy S8 phone is perfect for me as it holds files and is easy to operate.
5,This is such a great phone love it. Recommend it to anyone
5,"This phone is the epitome of design and function. This cellphone is the perfection of everything a phone can provide for us. A beautiful FHD+ AMOLED curved screen that makes phone weldy. Samsung has outdone itself, if only its OS is as perfect as iOS. The hardware capabilities is as it's best with 2.0 Bluetooth, an amazing camera, camera that can search up items on the internet for information...and plenty more. If you are daring enough to adapt to Samsung and google way of life, this is the phone for you."
4,"I needed a new phone as mine was about done, I'd had my previous phone also a Samsung for about 3-4 years and really like it so that was what guided me this time."
5,I upgraded from a Galaxy S4. Wow. What can I say. This is so smooth. I am happy.
5,Purchased this for my wife and she loves it. The camera is awesome and the screen is the best I've seen. No better on the market right now. Highly recommend this phone. I plan on getting one for myself now.
5,This phone has gorgeous display and its camera is superior to the latest iPiones.
5,"amazing display, nice processing speed and good aesthetic"
5,"Phone is sleek, functional, and intuitive. Always had a Samsung and Samsung phones have never let me down or been a problem; I'm sticking with Samsung. Camera quality is great and screen is large."
5,"Couldn't be happier. Going from S5 to S8 was a huge upgrade. This phone is amazing. Love the camera features, screen resolution, and just About everything it has to offer."
5,Love it so far! Still learning more everyday and amazed at all it does and can do.
5,Awesome smart phone. Been wanting one for a long time and finally got one.
5,"This is the best phone I have ever owned. It is lightning fast, and Crystal clear."
5,I was nervous about not having a button on the front but I hardly notice. I really like still having the buttons on the sides for volume and control. But the phone is super sleek and fits well in my hand. It is operating great and has a great quality screen. I would definitely buy again!!
5,Amazing display full of features and love the fact of expandable memory
4,Went from a S5 to the S8. I'm enjoying the new features and especially love the edge to edge screen size.
5,"Love it, switched from iphone and im glad i did!!!"
5,"So far I am very pleased with my phone. I love the display. It's way better than my old iPhone. It also came with lots of free stuff. Completely different operating system than Apple but I didn't know much about the iOS anyway. If I'm going to have to learn a new system anyway, might as well be one that has a nicer display and more memory."
5,"Great phone! I am very happy with my new phone. I waited four years before buying a new phone because I wanted to make sure it was the best. I am very glad I waited. 
The camera feature is really good. Takes great photos, very easy to use. The phone is easy to use, easy to store and sort contacts etc. I think people will like the features of the Galaxy 8. The only thing I wish Samsung did was make a belt clip. Samsung really is tops in cell phones."
5,Well this almost makes me forget the fireplace option on the previous Samsung. seems to have no problems so far and the camera takes great and crisp pics too. fast and like the infinity screen.
4,The phone seems very easy to navigate. I love the quality of the camera.
4,I LOVE THIS PHONE I AWAYS HAD THE GALAXY AND THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET
4,"This item is extremely fast, I use to own a note 2 and this phone by far blows it out of the water. Would recommend to anyone."
4,"I had no choice but to consider a new replacement phone, I went it without knowing the Samsung S8 was about to be released. I placed a pre-order and a few weeks later decided it would be worth the investment. So far so good."
5,"I went from a LG G3 to this and it's been great. The S8 is much faster, cooler during workloads, and the camera is next to none."
5,Extremely happy with phone performance. Capability to do SO much. Except upgrade. Beautiful screen.
5,Love the feel of the smooth screen! I tried putting a screen protector on it but didn't like it so I don't use one now. So far no scratches & I'm amazed because I just throw it in my purse with my keys sometimes.
5,"Great phone - nice upgrade from Galaxy S7. More memory, faster CPU, performance mode, and now uses the facial recognition login. The fingerprint reader on the back works great - took a bit to get used to it. The only issue is some games are not configured for the new resolution, so pin point moves don't always work well. If the resolution is changed, you have to turn off performance mode (but the games work better)"
4,"I had the phone for a few days and the screen was scratched accidentally.
I thought the Gorilla Glass 4, or 5 would help with better scratch protection. The Bixby option still does not work well for me.
The phone is solid, reliable, and easy to look at."
5,"I preordered this phone on best buy, the day it was released they provided me with great service and helped me transfer my files to my new phone. The phone battery is everything it last so long. I love the edge screen and the look of the phone. Samsung has done a great job yet again."
4,Great phone in the galaxy series perfect for anyone
5,"I love the size, battery is fantastic. Screen is great. I like the lock screen always on feature."
5,"I upgraded from S7 to S8, I should say like S8 more and more."
5,The phone has the best screen currently available in any smartphones in the market. Camera is excellent and takes good pictures even in low light. Battery life is also above average.
5,Seems like i say this every year ... except after the 6 (disappointment) ... but this phone is sweet! Battery Life ...Check! Performance...Check! Ease of Use ... Check! Customization ... Check! Camera ... Check! Yeah this is a winner!
5,"Still haven't figured out alot, but when I do I like the features. And there are many."
5,Great security features! I used it in the pool 5 five under water for less than 10 minutes while streaming music from IHEART radio to the big pool speakers. Of course once the video starts under water; it seals off and music stops. The HD 4K video and picture quality is astonishing! Then I can send the file to my Samsung Smart TV and see the video crystal clear! I even tried filming under water in the beach for less than 2 minutes. It worked. After use in the ocean ; I rinsed the phone with bottled water then dried up with my towel and it was ready to go on Facebook to post for the family to see!!!
5,Great phone that is compact yet has a large screen with great clarity. Fast processor that does not lag when multi tasking. Great camera with professional effects. Screen clarity is unmatched by other phones on the market. Only down side is that the Bixby button takes getting used to. Can be easy to hit with intending to change the volume setting. This is not a feature I use and would be nice if this button could be re-purposed.
4,I love the new phone but I am still learning how to use it!
5,For me this phone was a huge upgrade i had a note 4 do as far as phones go this was a big jump I thought I would miss the pen but so far it's great
5,Great phone has a awesome Camera and takes great photos and recordings slim easy to carry.
5,Absolutely love this phone! It's super easy to use and the graphics exceptional . Camera is amazing as well. Love the edge screen.
5,I LOVE THE S8. I LOVED THE S7 EDGE AND THIS IS EVEN BETTER. IT IS FAST AND BEAUTIFUL. LOVE THE SIZE. BEST PHONE EVER!!!
5,Great phone light weight easy to use and fast processing
5,Awesome phone great battery life light weight and fast processing speed
3,Phone calls consistently drops should of waited . Put pictures are great
5,This phone has the best battery life ever! So happy I chose this one over the iPhone
4,camera and Bixby (later) are good. great look and feel
4,"needed to upgrade from s6, didn't think s7 was worth the upgrade.
nice features"
5,Stupendous phone. Easy to set up and use. Very happy with it.
4,Nice design and performance. It really is a good phone
3,"The phone started having volume issues the second day of my purchase. While on a phone call, suddenly I could not hear the person I am talking to and they can't hear me. After the 12th time and different phone numbers I took it back. The parts were not available for repairs, so they exchanged it with stressors because they wanted to leave me with no replacement while they sent it back to the manufacturer . REALLY!!!
I've had two of those same issues with the new phone after one week. I waiting to verify because this time I did not have to hang up and call back to resume our conversation."
5,This is my second galaxy and it is best phone ever.
5,I had a Galaxy S6 before this phone. The screen is much nicer and the battery lasts longer. The Bixly button is cumbersome and gets in the way but I think this will be better when Bixly Voice is introduced.
4,"The up side, battery life is greatly improved. Downside, the functions are different than my last Samsung. The call quality is very good, the wifi is not as good as my last one. I love the ""wrap around"" screen, but it gets dirty very quickly. The camera if phenomenal, but I havent figured out how to change from selfie mode when going live on social media. The live format cuts in and out, so there is a lot of missing footage. I like the function of putting the phone on vibrate but you cannot truly silence the phone with the same button as before. You have to go into setting to turn off vibrate and ringtones. My old S-4 would allow you to truly silence using the volume button."
5,My last phone upgrade was 5 years ago and I really enjoy the new features and especially the camera on the new Galaxy 8. This phone is very user friendly and easy to use with the quick access.
4,I was using an iphone before switching to this one.
5,"Great camera, beautiful display, quick processor. Great phone."
4,The night I got it I was so overwhelmed with all the configuration after being with iPhone for almost 10 years. But I would like to think I'm tech savvy so I got over my fears fairly quickly. Does what they say it does.
5,love the infinity screen no complaints on this phone
5,There is no android phone better than this...top notch specs...amazing screen... love it.
5,"I've always loved Samsung phones and they out did themselves with the galaxy s8, it's probably the best phone on the market."
4,"Fast phone, amazing screen. Above average battery life, sub par camera in my opinion. I feel like the pixel has a better camera. Also below average fingerprint scanner in terrible location"
5,"Great phone, the battery life is outstanding and the screen, WOW, just WOW. The S6 had a great camera, hard to grasp how they made the S8's better. Going from the S6 to the S8 was simple, Samsung included Smart Switch in the system apps to make things super easy. Did the transfer via WiFi and when it was finished, all my apps and screens looked like they did on the S6."
4,Good product but help at Best Buy was almost non-existant! You shouldn't have promos if you aren't going to educate your staff about them.
5,This is one of the best Samsung smartphone I owned so far super fast yes I recommend the product.
5,"The most beautiful, fast, reliable phone I ever had. The screen is amazing. Love the phone."
5,"Packed with features and tools like the S8+ in slightly smaller body, this S8 is sure to please it's end user in all categories."
4,Newest Samsung Smart phone with large screen and fast processor.
5,"My wife loves the phone. She has had no issues, which is completely my wife's luck. 

She loves the camera, sound quality and overall performance of the phone.

Don't buy the glass that goes over the phone as it makes it extremely difficult to type. Instead of easy touch and go you will have to press the phone unnaturally hard and multiple times to text.

Also, if you are buying this phone for just the headphones Don't they aren't that impressive."
5,"Samsung really did a great job on this one, amazing screen, awesome phone."
5,"Samsung really did a great job on this one, amazing screen, awesome phone."
5,Samsung galaxy s8 nice sizes phone and not bulky and user friendly
5,Both my teenage son and I upgraded to the s8. I've had a samsung phone for years now and this phone is exceptional and easy to use.
5,"I'm a huge fan of Samsung phones. This phone is easy to use, beautiful from start to finish and worth every penny."
4,"Pre=ordered Samsung S8 during Promo to receive Oculus Viewer.
Received by FedEx on Roll-Out day- no standing in lines!
Was totally Bummed to have Software Glitch downloaded first day!
But, the dreaded QMA Glitch seems to have subsided.
Samsung S8 is what S6 should have been. Expandable Memory Card Slot, 64 Gb Internal memory, 4 Gb Ram. Excellent Video quality."
4,"Would be great except that having the fingerprint reader on the back is awkward and very inconvenient! Also, its placement next to the camera lens means that the lens always has fingerprints on it and constantly needs cleaning! The octicore processors are fast and make for really smooth operation with minimal wait for responses."
5,I have had this phone for 1 month now and have found it to be flawless at this point. This is my 3rd Samsung and have had nothing but good luck.
5,"Powerfull cellphone with all I need Wright now. performance , very fast interface , excelent camera , good amount of Basic memory plus expandible memory , over all a war machine!!!"
4,Best android phone in the market. Love the design and the performance so far has exceeded expectations.
5,Great upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy s4! User friendly and just overall a great phone!
5,Phone works great nice design fits well in hand I can reach the ends so it could be used with an ease
5,"The full screen on the ne S8 is amazing. Fingerprint reader can be a little awkward sometimes, but it may be due to being used to having it on the front."
3,If the screen durability wasn't so bad this phone would be great. The fingerprint scanner location is easy to get used to.
5,"I upgraded to an S8 from an S5, so this was a huge upgrade. Better screen, better battery, smoother operations, better camera, more camera features, Edge controls, better sound on calls, etc, etc. Upgrades over an S5 are too numerous to go into. The feel of the phone is great also. Yes, it's longer, but it's so thin and rounded edges just make it comfortable to hold. Overall, a great phone. If you get one, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Great phone, bright colors, no issues a of yet! I'd definitely recommend to everyone..."
5,Love this phone. Has the best camera ever. Thanks samsung
5,A lot of nice features and good battery life so far still trying to get used to it but so far awesome
3,"Need more time, but so far so good. I really need to learn a lot more about all the options available."
4,"It is a good phone. However, the keyboard is a little too small type on it"
4,"Previously I had an S4 and the phone was perfect, but in the last 2 years I started getting the 'SIM removed"" error and drove me nuts. The phone was always full and couldnt download emails or keep my apps. Time for a new one. 

I'm a tall guy, but this phone is too long. Hard to press buttons with 1 hand, I wish they kept the size of the S4

The screen is super sensitive. Occasionally I open up things or select all/delete something without knowing how I did it. 

Keyboard prediction/correction, still horrible, the best was on an old apple. 

Music app missing but can download. Voice commands are gone

IR port which I used, gone

Not sure yet but music has no bass, maybe my headset. 

With a case I constantly turn Bixby on instead of lowering volume. 

To turn on/off portrait mode, I have to swipe 4 times to get to the setting

I had to correct about half the words I typed already. 

Don't mind the curved edges, case doesnt really protect the glass. They should have left the weird 'stuff' for the S8+ (size and edge) 

But it's fast, screen is nice, takes nice pictures, video, Iris scanner and thumb print is cool, takes a nice size SD card and default 64GB is cool but why not 128?"
5,"Great Cell Phone, the delivery was very fast and in great conditions"
5,"I recently upgraded my phone from an S4 so this was kind of an adjustment. So far I am really liking it, it is definitely much faster. I love the screen. I am still getting used to some of the newer features and still exploring all it has to offer. So far I love my new S8!"
5,"I had the galaxy s7 before throughout having it, it slowed down and was dying too frequently. The s8 is beyond expectations."
4,updates for software listed would be great..........
5,Great size feels good in the hand. Fast processor. Takes great pictures and has good battery life. You can even see the screen in bright day light.
5,Ive been using this phone for almost a month and so far I dont see any part that dissapoints aside from samsung sold out on the immersive experience package on the release date.
5,"Is the best phone !!! It has great applications.
The camara is GREAT. Beautiful pictures"
5,I think this is the best Samsung galaxy yet. I love the curved screen and there are no edges so you get a complete full screen.
4,not near as easy to use as my S 4 I guess progress is measured by confusion.
4,"While very apprehensive to leave the apple ecosystem, I found the transition very easy after AFT (Android File Transfer) was loaded. Very happy with the screen, the camera, and the phone overall."
4,"almost too small for my fat fingers,hard to type. Don't like the double tap to open."
3,Had to have have it restarted by the Samsung Representitive.
5,"Easy to use, fast technology, excellent camera. Lots of new features."
5,This phone is awesome. I upgraded from the samsung s6 active and I love it. The only downfall is the location of the finger print sensor. But it's cool because I use the face recognition to unlock the phone :)
5,"So far I like everything about the Galaxy S8. Great features, really fast, awesome camera, and that screen...."
5,This phone has the best camera I have ever seen. Really easy to use also.
5,I love this phone. The battery lasts a very long time and tyhe 64gb of memory is way more than needed.
4,"Personally, I have used an iPhone since late 2011 and this is the first android phone I have owned. After having the iPhone 7 Plus (until it was stolen) I prefer the iPhone over the Samsung Galaxy S8. The flow of the phone as a whole is a lot smoother than the Galaxy S8. I really like the feel of the screen and the quality of the display on the screen compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. I do like the camera features on the Samsung Galaxy S8 better than the iPhone but the image stabilization is a bit shaky and rough. Also, the zoom on the Galaxy S8 isn't very smooth either, especially when you zoom in to a certain distance. Overall, I am very pleased with the phone, its camera, and the accessibility of certain features that aren't on iOS."
5,"best phone out there!!! great camera, fast, screen is awesome. Samsung is the best!!!"
5,"This has been the best phone yet. I have used the last few Samsung phones and I enjoy this one the best. Love the beautiful infinity display. Just like some others the fingerprint scanner is not in an optimal location, but I am getting used to it."
4,"The screen is really nice, but the fingerprint sensor does not work after some time and you need to restart the phone."
5,I absolutely LOVE my phone. Sleek design. Easy function.
5,I absolutely love this phone just for the camera. My 9 month old wiggles like crazy and it is so hard to get good pictures of her. This camera does a great job!
4,"Phone is great, battery life much better than my old s6, muuch quicker, better camera, etc, etc. On the downside, I can't find a screen protector that works with Spigen cases and the promotion for pre-ordering has been a terrible experience. Makes me question Samsung as a company thinking that they would have been more attentive to a successful launch after the Note failure."
5,"Love the phone. Went with the smaller phone thinking the + would be to big, but with the slim design, wish I had upgraded"
5,The screen is beautiful and speed of the phone is fantastic. I'm very happy with the purchase
5,"I had the s6 before, love my new s8. Little skinnier than the s6, I like that about it."
5,"I bought this phone for my wife as an upgrade to her Galaxy S6 and she claims that this phone is night and day better than her existing one. I was most excited that it is waterproof so that it can survive rainy Portland days or a brief splash from the kitchen sink. She loves that the screen size is large but the footprint is very small and she can still use it with one hand. The only small gripe that we have is where Samsung decided to put the fingerprint sensor, would have liked to see it centered on the back or hidden under the glass on the front.

Overall this phone is a rock star and anyone that picks it up should not be dissapointed."
5,"Awesome Screen, great camera. The fit in the had with the slimmer profile is fantastic. 

My only complaint... Finger pint scanner is on back of phone next to camera lens. I understand why, b/c the screen is so close to the edges, but being so close to the camera lens, I pretty much touch the lens every time before registering the fingerprint scanner causing fingerprints."
3,The screen doesn't work very well. I was surprised that this phone is so difficult to use.
4,"This phone fairly easy to transition to. Most controls are very similar to the past generations of Galaxy phones. Samsung needs to go back to the micro USB plug, though."
5,"So far the phone is great. Upgraded from an S6 and am very pleased with the performance and battery life, let alone the great screen."
4,"The phone has been good so far, I'm still learning though. The camera is really great."
5,"A little overpriced, but really good phone, battery is nice as well."
5,My daughter LOVES it!! She phone is perfect for her
5,"My last phone was the Galaxy S5 & now the S8. I must say they didn't disappoint again. The design is stunning. Samsung must have spent a lot of time & thought into the engineering of this phone. It has a large screen it feels great. It seems to be the best phone out on the market. Very fast phone, camera is top of the line, AKG headphones have excellent sound, transferring files from the old phone to the S8 was simple. This phone is definitely the best out right now."

5,"My daughter had to upgrade her Galaxy 5 and loves her new Galaxy 8, never hear a complaint. Keep it going Samsung!"
5,Very good updated version of the galaxy phone! I'm so glad they brought back the external SD card!!
5,"The galaxy s8 is Amazing! Fast, beautiful, the display is huge, water proof, what else can I say"
5,Its running the Android 7.0 and the performance so far has been impressive. I use the phone extensively and the battery lasts for at least 1.5 days.
5,This is the Best Phone i ever had. Love it. Great fan of Samsung Galaxy series.
5,phone looks great. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,"I went in to buy an S7 and after discussing the improved features of the S8 and the buy one get one free and $100 gift card for each with the BB associate, it was too good of a deal to pass up. Super happy with the phone and the deal."
5,Love this phone! I've been so excited to upgrade and this has lived up to all my expectations!
5,I have a loyal Samsung Android phone User since the s4 and I love my new phone. Samsung out did themselves this time. I don't know if I'll ever use all the functionally this phone has.
5,"This is an amazing device. I had a Galaxy S5 before upgrading to this and it is a HUGE change for the better. There was a slight learning curve for me but only because I didn't get the S6 and S7, so I wasn't gradually introduced to them. But yeah, I am really impressed with how all of the minor gripes I had with my S5 were blown away by the S8."
4,"Hate the screen saver, too hard to press the keys."
5,Super fast speed employee very helpful nice clarity easy to use
5,The backup and restore of previous phone settings was awesome. Kudos to the sales rep that helped me out. Phone is fast performing also. Too bad they changed the charge connector but they provide an adapter.
5,Left iPhone 6s plus and got this phone. Great size. Actually smaller phone but same size of iPhone 6s plus. Love the screen and operating system.
5,"I had s7 and upgrade it with s8, it's so good looking phone, great features, easy to use. Great phone overall."
4,I previously had the S6 and this is a vast improvement. It's super fast and has less of that terrible bloatware. Camera is not the best but it's good enough. Sound quality and reception are great!
5,I bought the s8 as an upgrade from the s6. I loved the s6 and I love the s8. The photos are amazing and the overall quality of the phone is great!
4,"The phone hardware is pretty fantastic and the new version of TouchWiz is much better than previous versions. Bixby is pretty useless so far, especially because it comes with Google Assistant through Android. Hope there are improvements for Bixby in the future and/or a native way to remap the Bixby button."
5,Love this phone. I bought this phone for my daughter to replace her note 3. She loves her phone
5,Everything is phone is capable of doing I'm just saying wow
5,Have had a Samsung for a while this is probably the best phone out there love the Infiniti screen
5,"An amazing and brilliant phone. Samsung never disappoints. I know every company has its issues but so far that I've had this phone since 21st of April I have no complaints. The processor is fast, the camera is amazing and the screen is beautiful. Plus it's water resistant how better can it get. Def. Recommend to all Samsung fans and for first time android users :)"
5,Much better than the s5 I had. Easy to use and beautiful. Good job samsung.
5,"I upgraded to the S8 from an S4, so this thing is way faster than my old phone. The battery is pretty good too. I can end a full day at about 50% with average use. The screen is beautiful."
5,I love my new Galaxy S8. Has great features. Amazing camera. So much to learn!!
4,I like it in general. Great touch fabulous screen awesome camera but weird fingerprint recognition location
5,So far I like my new phone. Lots of things to learn and do with it. The camera is great and fun to play with. I'm happy I got an upgrade.
5,Had my phone over a month now and it's safe to say it's the most beautiful phone I've owned..
5,"It feels great, looks great and works great. It's the best phone on the planet."
5,It's all that plus it charges quickly with good battery life and I live on the bloody phone
5,My favorite phone so far but I have had only 1 week. I am confident I will say the same thing in a year.
5,"I've been a Windows phone user from the beginning. I thought it would have been a hard transition, but I am absolutely floored with this phone. I love the lightweight feel of the phone. The ease of use. The finger scan is fun to use. Coming from a Windows phone with limited apps, I've gotten used to just using it for basics. With the galaxy 8 I feel as though I'm in heaven. The camera is beautiful and the zoom is awesome. It's so worth it. Now if I can only figure out how to turn back on the infinity screen."
5,"So far I only had a few days, but it works great. awesome picture quality. Just some getting use to new functions but overall cool."
4,Great phone with good camera and screen resolution. But need to improve the phone body quality.
5,This phone is a substantial upgrade over my Galaxy S5. Very happy so far. Looking forward to my free VR headset from Samsung. The battery last an entire day and charges fast.
5,This is the best cell phone ever. I totally recommend this phone.
4,"This phone essentially replaces the Edge line for Galaxy with more options for the ""edge"" screen. Very good battery life and an improved camera."
4,"Pros: Amazing Screen, fast processor, good functionality, touch screen responsiveness, edge feature is somewhat helpful. 
Cons: Fingerprint Scanner (location and responsiveness), Camera, Bottom Firing Speaker"
5,The Samsung Galaxy is one of the best phones on the market right now. The camera is amazing and the phone screen is very clear.
4,Pretty similar to the s7edge which I had. The fingerprint scanner is awkward being in the back.
5,"I like the Microsoft phone OS and I had hoped they would be serious about smart phones, but after plodding along with my MS 950 for a year and a half, I gave up and made the leap to Android and the Samsung S8. Wow what a difference. This is one impressive phone. I had pre-ordered it and have had it several days now. Everything worked right out of the box. It is quick on all fronts...OS, connectivity, battery charging. A great display and easily customizable organization. And the battery easily lasts a full day with decent usage. So far I am very happy with it. The only complaint is that I feel I have to put a case on it. While it is a great form-factor, the back is slippery and video tests on YouTube show it to be breakable if dropped. The case hides the beauty and feel of the body. Oh well."
5,I need the points. It's a phone. Its shiny. It works like a phone. Aliens technology is awesome.
5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the most beautiful phone in the world and the best phone, hands down. It's gorgeous just to look at, it's much lighter than any smartphone I have ever had even though it is longer and more narrower than the S6 which was a good phone but does not compete with the S8. The camera is great taking awesome photos and videos. The battery life is very very long. I use my phone all the time and do not have to charge my battery for 2 days. Highly recommended to everyone."
1,"I have been a Samsung user for many years . When my S5 went out, I jumped on the S8.
This is a total rush to market job by Samsung to fill in the S7edge fiasco in their market place. The phone is cumbersome to use, not well thought out, changed for change sake but not to improve usability or interface. Some things flat do not work and others are included but no one know how to use them. After the first major update, many features are totally messed up!! Save your money. The only good thing is the camera and all those features are not fully available."
1,My phone sucks. The aux cord when plugged in to my phone in my car it sounds horrible. All I'm hearing is crackling. And the screen and back of my phone shattered in two days of me having it. Worst phone ever.
2,"I got my first android phone with the galaxy s5 and here it is 4 years later and the same stuff carries over. Slow charging unless you use the fast wireless charger jack. Iphone charges the same regardless where you charge it. Also, when I streamed spotify it would skip alot like with a scratched cd, never did that on my iphone. Just not an android guy I guess."
4,Only issue is that screen protectors are a bit thicker than nomal for the curved screen making it less touch sensitive.
5,The features and look of the apps moved me from being an iPhone user to a very happy and excited Samsung user
4,App seem to crash more than they should. I've also had an issue using the camera where it tells me another app is using it and I need to restart my phone. The phone also eats a lot of ram running all the garbage Samsung apps that can't be shut down.
4,"This phone in fast, colors are vivid and user friendly."
5,This phone has been a huge upgrade from my last one in performance and is even less weight to carry around
1,"Let me start by saying I loved my old galaxy S5 so I went for the newest one when I decided to upgrade.....WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I'm on my third one with with a bad ear speaker, and I give up! After waiting in Best Buy three times now for almost 2 hours exchanging and transferring all my stuff from one phone to another, I've ordered a completely different phone from my carrier and will be talking on speaker phone till it gets here and I can take this lemon back."
5,Love the phone! Best phone out right now. Only phone with 4k capabilities and it's infinity screen is great. I suggest getting a case to insure your purchase being that the back will break easy.
1,"I am a loyal Samsung customer but within a week the phone screen has cracked in three places. Arrgh! The phone is an upgrade from my last Samsung S6 edge but if the screens cracks on carpet and wood within a week, I am very disappointed in this phone. A phone case should come standard if their screen cracks so much."
1,It's a good phone but i like iPhone much better. iPhone has better features and is a more sleek device. Also has the apps I want which Android does not.
3,"Pre-ordered for the $99 Immersive VR bundle, but wasn't available anymore when I try to claim it. $50 discount was only applicable if you did an installment plan, no discounts if you pay the phone outright. Basically I got nothing out of pre-ordering it."
