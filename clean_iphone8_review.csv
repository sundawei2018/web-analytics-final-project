3,purchased new iphone unlocked for friend no hassles except when was asked if wished receipt to be sent via email none was sent in order to be sure had proof of purchase with applecare had to return to store ask for it to be physically printed this is not good service why is it not possible to access my account digitally gain access to receipt print it at home instead of spending time expense driving phone by way is as usual great
4,it works can make calls on it can look up stuff on ol inter web thumbs up
4,probably not worth it if you re upgrading from iphone but if you re doing verizon payment plan why not right upgrades are faster processor wireless charging this method charges very slowly only beneficial overnight think faster cable charging can usually get battery life in about hour slightly better camera that really it upgraded from that iphone se that seemed very fast it ran same processor as 6s mean honestly at certain point faster processors won matter glass back is very pretty but outer rim is still aluminum so it is very prone to dents everyone is waiting for iphone anyway haha
5,iiphone has glass screen glass back have slate grey color is really closer to black very nice to hold ant wireless charging is very handy vibrant screen color blazing fast phone
5,traded my son iphone for iphone battery last much longer everything runs smoother faster another happy purchase from best buy
