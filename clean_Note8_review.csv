5,this is my first galaxy after being apple fanboy for years this is pretty much perfect phone it feels compact for having such big screen camera is great it has good battery
,
2,phone it self is really nice has some really nice features loved iris scanner battery seemed to last nice amount for me but within first day of having it it would randomly restart it would happen about 6-10 times day got it swapped out with new phone it did same thing after taking it to samsung in local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it he did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it but no solution yet this seems to be common problem even though it not being widely reported on do search for galaxy s8 restarting it going on weeks since release no comment from samsung see samsung community boards people are calling samsung they are still telling them ve never heard of this ended up returning mine before days
,
5,galaxy s8 is fantastic phone it has powerful processor expandable memory is durable against elements only have to minor complaints about phone it super slippery phone is made completely of glass there is no plastic backing grip surface anywhere on phone so be prepared to buy necessary case just so you can hold onto phone bixby button bixby is most useless personal assistant application among all phones you will find yourself meaning to hit power button but wind up pressing bixby button which is right across from power button on accident which starts bixby app while you can turn off access to bixby app when you swipe right on phone app will always start when you click hardwired bixby button there is no way to disable this button functionality in phone best solution ve come up with is to buy case pop out case button that corresponds with bixby button so you cannot physically press it with bixby now out of my life my experience with phone is phenomenal highly recommend phone
,
5,apple guy multiple ipads imacs macbooks but ve never really warmed up to iphone despite all my family having one as well as having my own from work quite honestly longtime blackberry holdout but lack of apps finally got to me almost waited for new keyone but bought this instead am so glad did this phone is truly amazing
,
5,love this phone phone itself is so beautiful screen is even better it feels like holding future upgraded from galaxy s6 thought would really miss physical home button but pressure sensitive home button on s8 is awesome don mind placement of fingerprint scanner can still reach it easily on back great front facing camera also phone comes with micro usb to usb adaptor so don even need to buy new car charger
,
5,am very happy with new s8 it has been very easy to use hold would not go without case at all get screen protector protection plan asap
,
5,this phone is absolutely amazing looks good processes fast uses less battery life than it predecessor
,
5,awesome phone what else is there to say absolutely beautiful design stunning display packed with plenty of storage for most enough power to do anything you reasonably want phone to do
,
5,best phone ever very easy to use with every app gadjet available pictures video are awesome recently used it camping where there was no tv reception to watch netflix amazon youtube paired with screenbeam mini you can stream without wifi connection
,
3,overall phone is ok however it seems to activate apps on it own when it is in my pocket it pocket dials lot even though have locked it before putting it in my pocket touchscreen on bottom instead of home button is bit of hassle know phone has many new features but battery life is disappointing if you have any real significant use
,
4,it great phone just wish they wld do away with curved edge of phone because it seems pointless also makes it difficult to use good screen protectors phone cases
,
4,wireless earphones do not work well while jogging cannot listen to audio because it breaks up
,
5,this is first time owning another phone that wasn iphone picked galaxy s8 because it had ear phone jack in addition to charging jack that apple removed from their newest phones at first it was hard to transition from iphone now having best camera ever with galaxy s8 now finding can post faster to facebook with one button options that iphone can compete with can add memory without having to rent cloud did say can add lots of memory that holds every photo apple never allows you to add memory with sd card apple always upgraded until your phone would not work anymore some due to memory issues not any more with galaxy s8
,
4,learning curve from being iphone user is little difficult otherwise it excellent phone
,
5,im very impressed this phone survived one cycle in washing machine
,
5,samsung hit another home run with s8 bixby is bomb
,
5,love it my new galaxy s8 gives plenty storage for my plus pics contacts this phone does everything but take ur blood sugar ill never go back to apple again appledivorce
,
5,former iphone only user dropped my iphone in river fishing last week now it just paper weight decided that someone like me active outdoors man should get phone that can handle elements galaxy s8 checked off all my needs waterproof rating is higher than iphone gorilla glass is stronger basically had dropped s8 in river last weekend would still have it not to mention it does almost everything better than iphone it has unbelievable display just sit watch 4k videos on youtube annoy my family showing them how amazing it is video camera is top notch too just love this phone bought uag case for it look it up now it even more dynomite will have this phone for long time
,
4,to many security loops it is lot more complex then my previous s5
,
4,phone is very good price was very good got it on sale at off plus got in trade for my old galaxy s5 very pleased with phone so far great design faster than my old phone plenty of storage battery is good there were couple of glitches some of my apps didn transfer from my old phone so had to download them again old phone voice mail didn get transferred to new phone had to spend quite bit of time with at to fix that also it still too time consuming too much paperwork to get new phone upgrade spent over two hours at best buy there should be way to streamline all that but it good product nice looking phone it got case screen protector those are little pricey for what they are but necessary would give phone four half stars if possible
,
3,phone is useful but it is not as agile as my s5 it is irritating that something that is made well is removed from market when upgrading occurs why not just update internals maintain already functional format curved screen is no big deal phone just another fad selling point my expectations are for amount of money spent want something strong functional don bother me me with foolish fads
,
2,realize have hard time changing phones however this one is not user friendly had to turn off touch setting as phone is really sensitive swiping through screens frustrating battery drains very quickly definately not happy with this purchase have bit of time for first time in phone purchases am seriously thinking of returning it
,
5,so far am enjoying this phone very much it is quick easy to use have already learned how to customize it to my liking this might seem easy to you but for year old that is not smartphone savvy think doing good have not used camera much yet but pictures have taken look very good still have to try upload something to fb one of these days transferring everything from old phone to this one was quite easy also was fortunate enough to have people at bestbuy do it for me when bought it but all they did was hook up cables it pretty much did work for them would say use my phone less than most younger people so my battery seems to last good while would usually be at battery with my galaxy but with this galaxy s8 lowest have seen my battery go down to is so to me that is big difference have not had any issues with calling with this phone although my wife also has same phone sometimes people have trouble hearing her but we are not sure if it is her phone theirs overall am very pleased with this phone but let see how it does in next months so
,
3,its ok definitely better than tv speakers but was pretty disappointed with bass overall its ok but for that price think it could be lot better

,
4,replaced my galaxy for this galaxy 8s some features are nice it was easy to learn new navigation system curved edge means have to use plastic screen guard instead of glass one plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils charging cable is shorter than on my galaxy s5 have dropped it times this week because of picking it up from charger cord is too short never dropped my galaxy s5 needs charging daily
,
3,samsung carrier locked phones are just worth year before they start getting slow would have preferred to buy unlocked phone instead of carrier locked but due to financing options with att had to stick with it just think twice before going for any samsung smartphones since they have tendency to slow down quickly carrier updates are generation old

,
4,after surprise wave flooded my beach blanket all my stuff was pleasantly surprised to have my phone in perfect working condition after fact two weeks following took spill into pool again working perfectly phone even advised me not to charge thru port until fully dry as moisture was detected features are pretty cool nice sleek however it freezes often enough to annoy me wherein have to hold down buttons until my fingers hurt secs later to restart it wait mins before fully reloaded when say often its been maybe times total in months enough to have gotten annoying but am super active on my phone with apps searching etc so am assuming it has to do with using up my ram needing reboot just like my laptop would very happy with phone staying in galaxy family but finally having some water protection gives alot of peace of mind also was easy to find nice case liked on amazon much cheaper than otterbox liking unicorn beetle brand cases holds tough

,
5,love how samsung found middle ground with edge display it comfortable to hold without feeling like you re going to drop it like s7 edge infinity screen is gorgeous easily best screen on market love pro mode on camera for manual settings only gripe don use bixby so having entire button devoted to it is super annoying wish could program button to open whatever wanted still star quality
,
5,had samsung galaxy s5 for many years was satisfied with it however after reading about new s8 model watching it from one of my sons decided to buy it am very pleased with that decision it is excellent device with many new features easy to use its design is nice
,
3,there are lot of great aspect to this phone but it not as adaptable as other phones there certain things that you can change controlle that is more of annoyance with this phone for instance text dictionary normally when you try say one thing phone will auto correct it to what it thinks you were trying to say then when you change that specific word sentence there is way to add to dictionary but not on this phone this next sentence will be unaltered so you can see what taking about in whay way dies auto correct dies this its supposed to say in what way does auto correct does this so now your left repeating same mistakes over over again its annoying there should be way do add words to your dictionary so you don have to keep editing what you re trying to say there isn other thing that kinda annoys me is that they have all these hi-tech ways of opening your phone like retina recognition finger print voice activated etc but they don have most basic thing it annoys he ll out of me that double tap to open it does not exist on this phone they have list of ways to unlock your phone they are all really cool but just want basic to open my phone when its off shouldn be process just double tap screen to turn on pattern lock to open done there are other annoying things but won go into details about it reason giving this stars is because they do have great featureson this phone but texting does suck last sentence for this review unaltered had to changethe spelling on each sentence granger at least ten aspirate times before out period down have fin translating this

,
4,went from s4 to galaxy s8 so performance speed are greatly improved in my situation phone is easy to use after few days of adjustment still having difficulty with bixby voice recognition do wish there were not so many pre-installed apps they are confusing clutter up phone will probably not use half of them but it is unclear if can delete them without harming phone prefer to select my apps one feature definitely do not appreciate is auto-correct would rather risk some spelling errors in my texts than to have my words changed have actually sent out few texts that did not even make sense because phone made corrections that didn notice in time still haven found way to turn this feature off but overall love new phone would recommend it
,
4,still learning features great that there are classes to attend to educate yourself on phone wish there were skype capable classes for physically challenged phone owner though
,

,
3,after being long time iphone user decided to break out of my mold had s8 for under two weeks but noticed that had voicemails with no missed calls poor call quality this was in comparison to my almost year old iphone when called carrier to see if it could be issue with new phone was told that iphone had larger antenna that there was update forthcoming to correct call quality issue well needless to say with less than day left to bail out decided to go back to my old phone as used it primarily as phone hard to believe difference between two but it was clear differentiation loved features of s8 but not it ability as phone
,
5,ve only had s8 for week but really like it so far just upgraded from s5 so it has taken me little to get use to it with change camera is much nicer
,
4,had s6 for last years figured it was time for upgrade so far happy with my choice don really care about curved screen but don dislike it hate dedicated bixby button wish that it could be reprogrammed without having to download third-party app

5,this is my 3rd samsung galaxy each one has been better than one before got my husband got other than size they seem to be same iris scanner is fantastic no more fumbling with fingerprints just swipe screen look at phone it unlocked if you liked fingerprint scanner then this upgrade may not be for you they moved touch sensor to back right next to rear camera it really hard to register each fingerprint nearly impossible to scan one with case on phone
,
5,this phone has been great so far have not had any issues
,
5,had note before much larger wanted phone that would fit into my pocket thus s8 now wish had gotten s8 as it is still more narrow than note but am happy with s8 it is great phone still finding out all cool features
,
4,it fast responsive device it looks feels sleek is quite thin light wish battery was replaceable it also bit slippery wish back was somewhat textured know that it uses usb-c connector so ended up also getting few new cables to replace my sub mini cables
,
5,wrote review of s8 bought both prefer size of s8 over plus excellent camera screen better life everything did mention screen there is nothing can complain about with this device honestly fingerprint sensor is way better than what lot of people are saying in reviews but also have larger hands if you re not tht kind of person who has to choose between phone putting food on your table buy this
,
5,so far have complaints this phone is awesome very smooth fast great pictures
,
4,don usually like getting new phone because it takes days to get everything figured out this has been overall pretty easy ve had to go to youtube time two for some minor features but all normal use functions are easy to use
,
5,upgraded from s5 there is such difference in everything
,
2,very disappointed with best buy enroll for training got their it was cancel no one called me emailed me about cancellation someone at store help me but still having problems with my phone can delete email do it comes back on again my husband sometimes gets emergency note classes are schedule to early that cant make it
,
5,hated to get new phone but samsung made it easy with included sync cable that allows you to transfer everything that you want from old phone to new one love feel of s8 still learning all features but camera is excellent battery life is great so far
,
5,my wife both upgraded our phone recently mine from galaxy 5s active to galaxy my wife from phone to galaxy she debated for quite awhile about switching but now that she has she is very glad she did

4,so purchased this phone for my wife took it home was immediately having issues when phone was established on home wi-fi wi-fi would turn off on its own if screen was locked have to be manually turned on took phone to at to discover phone had malware went to return device to best buy manager was rude kept interrupting me when was explaining situation refused to return device told me had to go to original purchase store he stated if he took it back he would have to have geek squad look at it but then refused to have them look at it device was returned at original store with no issues end result is phone had issue got it fixed rude managers don help situations
,
5,very happy with this smart phone had iphone before so there was little bit of learning curve but features are easy to use
,
5,it is unique phone as compared to other phones in market
,
5,would refer this phone to anyone looking for high quality dependable support
,
5,this is my first phone that is not iphone have only had phone for weeks but have been very happy so far screen on phone is very impressive fingerprint sensor on back takes little getting used to but overall very nice phone
,
5,speed of this phone is amazing storage is monumental expandable best upgrade ever nothing else can touch it
,
5,have been samsung phone user while this phone is great
,
5,like this phone much better than my samsung galaxy s4
,
5,upgraded from s5 to s8 it isn much heavier then s5 videos graphics are great haven tried bigsby yet but phone stands on its own without this feature
,
5,color is wonderful though that not point love everything about phone only things like to mention is that since there is no actual home button when he phone freezes it goes haywire on minimal scale don really use bixby he kind of unnecesary to me but then only use this phone on average scale upgrade from samsung s3 so layout mechanics are definitely different other than that ve only had few weeks to actually make judgement on it so ll update if anything happens
,
5,it bit slim but you get used to it had samsung s3 until recently upgraded so way things work on this phone is much different it just takes time getting used to it really like this side window option that given honestly only use my phone for everyday usage nothing fancy ok things ve noticed when using phone for too long it freezes what phone doesnt but because of lack of physical home button it goes kinda crazy just push lock screen wait moment some apps are missing it simple features have study app with bookmark feature where you can select paragraph bookmark it simple yes but this phone doenst do that my gmail also doesn open up my whole mail it hard to explain but it missing something know these are app issues but still just wanted to let you know
,
5,ve had galaxy phone since original so fairly familiar with them this is by far best one ve ever had much faster better build than my previous s5 battery life is massive improvement
,
5,love samsung products but this one is one of best screen is flawless size is just right
,
4,s8 is great phone but glass cover is fragile phone was dropped first night lower right glass cover fractured definitely recommenced insurance protective cover before leaving store
,
5,my s4 went for swim had been reviewing s8 for upgrade for awhile was pleased with ability to retrieve all my info from my old phone including messages screen settings etc it is big change for me but finding it easy to navigate
,
5,overall this is great phone have not had any problems yet understand complaints about awkward placement of fingerprint scanner but it has not really been problem for me especially when you use iris scanner came from s6 s8 is much snappier faster my battery lasts whole day easy now
,
5,have to say this is one of best beautiful phones ever had
,
5,nice size easy to handle big upgrade from my s5
,
4,happy though not with beveled edges they don seem to make glass screen protector for these phones that stay on love new type usb connector though it will take while to rid ourselves of all old devices with usb minis
,
5,works great has amazing picture quality features
,
5,absolutely love this phone was always android user decided to try apple just couldnt get it tried this new s8 wow totally in love everything ive always wanted more great screen graphics memory programs processes
,
5,overall great phone hope battery last camera is great
,
5,as expected from samsung flagship phone it is well built specs get job done originally did not like idea of curved edge on both sides but warming up to it objection was over having case that could adequately protect those curves still be functional having screen protector that would not get in way it was decided that would forgo screen protector as many reviews stated that there was issues using edges hope that otterbox case can properly protect screen but guess that is what accidental protections plans are for
,
5,works with otterbox cover so no need to take cover off to charge
,
5,this phone much smoother than galaxy some of same problems that had with galaxy don have any more with galaxy love this phone
,
4,takes little getting use to but finger print scanner is biggest downfall
,
4,needed to replace my samsung s4 so this was great option still learning how to use it
,
5,upgraded from galaxy s5 to new s8 love it great phone samsung didn disappoint
,
5,great phone great camera like expandable memory
,
4,phone is amazing it looks great performs really well was little worried to move to samsung phone because always hear about all bloatware added to phones there is some but do find most of software useful
,
5,this is very nice phone with everything that is needed only wish would have purchased larger model s8
,
5,love this phone it is smaller than my last phone but powerful also really like new bixby feature
,
5,really love phone is amaxing do recommend it
,
5,camera bixby are excellent fingerprint sensor might be little difficult to use
,
5,love how easily customizable this phone is theme shop has cute themes icons duel edge design looks nice samsungs are really easy to use screenshot gestures camera gestures are bonus
,
5,can really tell difference with new screen
,
5,nice size to grip compair s7edge fast reponse touch feel one thing finger print sensor on back
,
5,like size of new galaxy s8 more comfortable grip
,
5,went from s5 to s8 it was like going from flip phone to smart one am still learning about all features absolutely love fact that battery will last whole day needing recharge even when it being used love new cameras too
,
5,great phone love screen size easy to use internet
,
4,product screen shape does not very well accommodate attachment of screen saver
,
5,purchased samsung galaxy s8 having previously owned galaxy s6 edge so have used some of features samsung has provided past couple years difference on this phone is am using more of those features than did before fingerprint option is better now with reader being on back my hand is usually holding it right there anyway so that helps me to keep from entering code every time although have tried facial recognition prefer not to use it it just doesn seem as secure reliable as pin fingerprint couple of other nice features is ability to sync my google accounts with mail photos drive etc have not yet used bixby feature but it seems like it is capable of learning your habits providing you with customized content that would be beneficial plan to give that try samsung pay is so easy on this phone am using it now as well one last option will mention is when updated to this phone brought over my most used apps they seem to run better on this phone battery life is way better than s6 leave location on most of time now my battery keeps its charge much better jordan at best best mobile in norman oklahoma sooner mall was very knowledgeable about products as well as options available he gave me all available promotions including fast charge wireless charger gift card appreciate his help in deciding what accessories to purchase for this phone iphone my wife decided to buy also jordan helped us get set up in our new phones by transferring from our old phones right in store
,
5,hoping for miracle my wife breaks phone no matter what this time added insurance protection as well
,
5,bought this phone few weeks ago which is amazing but experience was not great one had to give up my phone number which corporate told me was unnecessary would have to spend to change back was not given details of at plan which included me having to buy direct tv in order to use hbo package which had been promised was not case then corporate said was lie experience in purchasing from representative was not entirely great but phone deal in buying phone was is great
,
5,like playing my games on bigger screen makes game more fun
,
5,really love bigger screen almost didn update from my s5 didn think there would be that much difference between screens but there is also like rapid picture taking ability almost like pro
,
5,great phone beautiful screen fast processor sleek design way overpriced though

,
5,this is my second galaxy it is best phone ever
,
5,had galaxy s6 before this phone screen is much nicer battery lasts longer bixly button is cumbersome gets in way but think this will be better when bixly voice is introduced
,
4,up side battery life is greatly improved downside functions are different than my last samsung call quality is very good wifi is not as good as my last one love wrap around screen but it gets dirty very quickly camera if phenomenal but havent figured out how to change from selfie mode when going live on social media live format cuts in out so there is lot of missing footage like function of putting phone on vibrate but you cannot truly silence phone with same button as before you have to go into setting to turn off vibrate ringtones my old s-4 would allow you to truly silence using volume button
,

5,huge fan of samsung phones this phone is easy to use beautiful from start to finish worth every penny
,
4,pre ordered samsung s8 during promo to receive oculus viewer received by fedex on roll-out day no standing in lines was totally bummed to have software glitch downloaded first day but dreaded qma glitch seems to have subsided samsung s8 is what s6 should have been expandable memory card slot gb internal memory gb ram excellent video quality
,
4,would be great except that having fingerprint reader on back is awkward very inconvenient also its placement next to camera lens means that lens always has fingerprints on it constantly needs cleaning octicore processors are fast make for really smooth operation with minimal wait for responses
,

,
5,phone works great nice design fits well in hand can reach ends so it could be used with ease
,
5,full screen on ne s8 is amazing fingerprint reader can be little awkward sometimes but it may be due to being used to having it on front
,
3,if screen durability wasn so bad this phone would be great fingerprint scanner location is easy to get used to
,
5,upgraded to s8 from s5 so this was huge upgrade better screen better battery smoother operations better camera more camera features edge controls better sound on calls etc etc upgrades over s5 are too numerous to go into feel of phone is great also yes it longer but it so thin rounded edges just make it comfortable to hold overall great phone if you get one you won be disappointed
,
5,great phone bright colors no issues of yet definitely recommend to everyone
,
5,love this phone has best camera ever thanks samsung
,
5,lot of nice features good battery life so far still trying to get used to it but so far awesome
,
3,need more time but so far so good really need to learn lot more about all options available
,
4,it is good phone however keyboard is little too small type on it
,
4,previously had s4 phone was perfect but in last years started getting sim removed error drove me nuts phone was always full couldnt download emails keep my apps time for new one tall guy but this phone is too long hard to press buttons with hand wish they kept size of s4 screen is super sensitive occasionally open up things select all delete something without knowing how did it keyboard prediction correction still horrible best was on old apple music app missing but can download voice commands are gone ir port which used gone not sure yet but music has no bass maybe my headset with case constantly turn bixby on instead of lowering volume to turn on off portrait mode have to swipe times to get to setting had to correct about half words typed already don mind curved edges case doesnt really protect glass they should have left weird stuff for s8 size edge but it fast screen is nice takes nice pictures video iris scanner thumb print is cool takes nice size sd card default 64gb is cool but why not
,
5,great cell phone delivery was very fast in great conditions
,
5,recently upgraded my phone from s4 so this was kind of adjustment so far am really liking it it is definitely much faster love screen am still getting used to some of newer features still exploring all it has to offer so far love my new s8

,
4,updates for software listed would be great
,
5,great size feels good in hand fast processor takes great pictures has good battery life you can even see screen in bright day light
,
5,ive been using this phone for almost month so far dont see any part that dissapoints aside from samsung sold out on immersive experience package on release date
,
5,is best phone it has great applications camara is great beautiful pictures
,
5,think this is best samsung galaxy yet love curved screen there are no edges so you get complete full screen
,
4,not near as easy to use as my guess progress is measured by confusion
,
4,while very apprehensive to leave apple ecosystem found transition very easy after aft android file transfer was loaded very happy with screen camera phone overall
,
4,almost too small for my fat fingers hard to type don like double tap to open
,
3,had to have have it restarted by samsung representitive
,
5,easy to use fast technology excellent camera lots of new features
,
5,this phone is awesome upgraded from samsung s6 active love it only downfall is location of finger print sensor but it cool because use face recognition to unlock phone

,
5,this phone has best camera have ever seen really easy to use also
,
5,love this phone battery lasts very long time tyhe 64gb of memory is way more than needed
,
4,personally have used iphone since late this is first android phone have owned after having iphone plus until it was stolen prefer iphone over samsung galaxy s8 flow of phone as whole is lot smoother than galaxy s8 really like feel of screen quality of display on screen compared to iphone plus do like camera features on samsung galaxy s8 better than iphone but image stabilization is bit shaky rough also zoom on galaxy s8 isn very smooth either especially when you zoom in to certain distance overall am very pleased with phone its camera accessibility of certain features that aren on ios
,
5,best phone out there great camera fast screen is awesome samsung is best
,
5,this has been best phone yet have used last few samsung phones enjoy this one best love beautiful infinity display just like some others fingerprint scanner is not in optimal location but am getting used to it

,
5,absolutely love my phone sleek design easy function
,
5,absolutely love this phone just for camera my month old wiggles like crazy it is so hard to get good pictures of her this camera does great job
,
4,phone is great battery life much better than my old s6 muuch quicker better camera etc etc on downside can find screen protector that works with spigen cases promotion for pre-ordering has been terrible experience makes me question samsung as company thinking that they would have been more attentive to successful launch after note failure
,
5,love phone went with smaller phone thinking would be to big but with slim design wish had upgraded
,
5,screen is beautiful speed of phone is fantastic very happy with purchase
,
5,had s6 before love my new s8 little skinnier than s6 like that about it
,
5,bought this phone for my wife as upgrade to her galaxy s6 she claims that this phone is night day better than her existing one was most excited that it is waterproof so that it can survive rainy portland days brief splash from kitchen sink she loves that screen size is large but footprint is very small she can still use it with one hand only small gripe that we have is where samsung decided to put fingerprint sensor would have liked to see it centered on back hidden under glass on front overall this phone is rock star anyone that picks it up should not be dissapointed
,
5,awesome screen great camera fit in had with slimmer profile is fantastic my only complaint finger pint scanner is on back of phone next to camera lens understand why screen is so close to edges but being so close to camera lens pretty much touch lens every time before registering fingerprint scanner causing fingerprints
,
3,screen doesn work very well was surprised that this phone is so difficult to use
,
4,this phone fairly easy to transition to most controls are very similar to past generations of galaxy phones samsung needs to go back to micro usb plug though
,
5,so far phone is great upgraded from s6 am very pleased with performance battery life let alone great screen

,
5,need points it phone its shiny it works like phone aliens technology is awesome
,
5,samsung galaxy s8 is most beautiful phone in world best phone hands down it gorgeous just to look at it much lighter than any smartphone have ever had even though it is longer more narrower than s6 which was good phone but does not compete with s8 camera is great taking awesome photos videos battery life is very very long use my phone all time do not have to charge my battery for days highly recommended to everyone
,
1,have been samsung user for many years when my s5 went out jumped on s8 this is total rush to market job by samsung to fill in s7edge fiasco in their market place phone is cumbersome to use not well thought out changed for change sake but not to improve usability interface some things flat do not work others are included but no one know how to use them after first major update many features are totally messed up save your money only good thing is camera all those features are not fully available
,
1,my phone sucks aux cord when plugged in to my phone in my car it sounds horrible all hearing is crackling screen back of my phone shattered in two days of me having it worst phone ever
,
