5,ve had phone for nearly month now love it probably didn need to upgrade as my galaxy s5 was perfectly functional although seemed to be running slower not much of phone-tographer but cameras seem to be big improvement over s5 camera functions too feel more intuitive quicker im not huge fan of curved edges aside from allowing more comfort for hand edge feels more like gimmick than anything it essentially disappears once phone is in case which is almost necessity considering price understand some might find it annoying that fingerprint sensor is now on back of phone but haven yet gotten onboard with biosecurity technology still like my digit pin so can speak to iris scanner facial recognition either was worried about absence of tactile home button but it hasn been issue bixby like biosecurity is something haven found use for yet it exclusive button is very close to volume down button which can be mildly aggravating if you are relying on touch alone to minimize sound speaking of sound speaker is now on bottom of phone as opposed to back as someone who watches listens to good deal of media on my phone find this change from my s5 great improvement as for battery life ve been extremely satisfied so far was very happy with my s5 battery life find that my s8 lasts considerably longer am slightly nervous about not having access to my battery though over two half years used my s5 did have to remove battery handful of times to reset phone due to unresponsiveness glitches another improvement over s5 is lack of plastic back which made that phone feel cheap conversely higher end metal glass back of this phone make it feel incredibly fragile it too bad that something so sleek well-designed requires case to keep it from scratches scuffs cracks advertised infinity screen is non-existent with addition of even slimmest case lastly really like included headphones in comparison to those of s5 they are little more substantial in ear keeping them from popping out also allowing good deal of noise-cancellation cord feels to be made of sturdy metal mesh that comes off as rugged long-lasting
5,very hard to change from iphone because we intended on waiting for iphone took plunge very pleased with s8 very fast simple can say we will be going back to iphone
5,switched from lg g5 phone is very fast so far my battery is lasting longer than day with lot of use left screen on which still looks great as someone else pointed out screen protectors are pain not just zagg one none of them seem to fit slight curve phone is fast looks amazing
5,camera is great phone apps are easy to work with loving it better than my iphone 6s
5,love this phone all that it can do always buy our phones from best buy they take great care of their customers
4,so was really excited to get this phone it looks great it fast call clarity is superb screen size is amazing camera is top notch but screen has already cracked phone has not been dropped yet like to think take good care of it noticed small spec in screen one afternoon it got worse over next few days now it runs up down entire screen honestly have no idea what did to make this happen guess now am stuck with it for more months luckily none of functionality seems lost so am still enjoying it for most part
5,this phone is awesome no matter what way you put it design is freakin beautiful awesome screen thin it fast everything yoou want in smartphone well worth money
5,very nice phone it latest flagship phone from samsung it does not disappoint screen is beautiful performance is snappy usb-c port is convenience importantly to me new samsung s8 s8 support video-out via usb-c port you need to buy usb-c to hdmi adapter separately though
5,decided time price were right to upgrade from my galaxy s5 which had for about three years to s8 overall am pleased with it compared to s5 s8 is thinner narrower made of slick shiny guerrilla glass this might be good for smaller hands to hold but for me this phone required case for better grip so after week of use decided to purchase urban armor gear monarch case which provides right amount of width grip as well protection still fits in my pocket without being bulky picture is bright clear even on lowest setting external speaker at bottom of phone sounds surprisingly good too you just have to remember not to keep your hand over it you ll muffle sound of course you could also use enclosed earbuds provided by akg your own as this phone has headphone jack calls ve made so far have come in loud clear use retina scan to unlock phone it works very well so far also plan to get fast charge pad but for now using fast charge cord it came with just few suggestions for best buy have few sample cases at display table so customers can compare feel of phone both with without case found out my best buy credit card is not supported on samsung pay android pay even though it has citi logo called samsung pay help desk was told card was not supported because it was issued by best buy rather than citi so am hoping best buy can lobby for all its credit card members to get best buy credit card included with samsung pay android pay know would use that app
3,as always galaxy s8 is step forward for mobile technology though some of choices they made are rather bizarre what do admire is new super amoled display which works well in almost any lighting situation without manually adjusting your brightness also like other typical things like external memory good screen size 4k resolution unfortunately as mentioned previously there are few things not totally comfortable with for instance edge screen has been nuisance while attempting to type until had to turn it off bixby commands are way too easy to trigger for example if you re trying to adjust volume of something your finger slips you turn bixby on swipe left on your home screen too much bixby turns on don get me wrong like bixby just wish that it wasn so intrusive finally for one of my biggest gripes they changed aspect ratio of phone you see instead of expanding in both dimensions galaxy s8 decided to expand only vertically while this means that it can better fit in places like cup holders pants pockets it also means that they changed aspect ratio to wouldn have as much of issue with this if more things were integrated with that lot of apps are stuck in changing that could break application this means that of screen is wasted on black space this is something hope they go back on with galaxy s9 overall think that galaxy s8 is just okay which is bad for samsung
5,long time iphone user switching to far superior galaxy s8 battery life is great even in high performance mode super fast charging don feel like have to ration my battery make my phone wall phone
5,when samsung announced coral blue color my wife just had to have it what great upgrade for s6 superfast gorgeous screen wireless charging is awesome camera head shoulders above s6 may get s8 for myself
5,have always been iphone person whenever ve strayed away from iphone ve always gone back to it after couple weeks but not this time samsung galaxy s8 is awesome coming from iphone plus it took little while to get used to narrowness of s8 but screen size is actually slightly bigger diagonally than iphone plus so didn feel need to get s8 size of this phone is perfect it fits so much better in pockets purses etc than iphone plus camera on s8 is stunning colors are true depth clarity are on point with improvements samsung has made to front-facing camera you don end up looking all distorted like on previous galaxy models s8 is fast not experiencing any lag when quickly switching between apps playing games battery is decent but iphone plus battery was better although it is nice to have couple different power-saving modes on s8 being able to customize everything on s8 is really great so is being able to have all kinds of widgets since last time had android phone years ago there have been so many improvements made to play store apps for apple android seem to basically be same now which is great also feel that am able to make my phone more secure with android as opposed to apple all in all happy with switch made to s8 from iphone
5,phone is beautiful sleek even some of typical bloatware is uninstallable s8 so far is fabulous with plenty of awesome new features tweaks that being said below is link to top of line screen protector that best buy stocks for s8 do not buy this screen protector read reviews you won regret it http www bestbuy com site zagg-invisibleshield glass-curve screen-protector for-samsung galaxy-s8 transparent skuid
5,have enjoyed using this phone so much that feel need to write one of my first online reviews my last two phones were iphone iphone enjoyed both very much only thing disliked about either was battery life neither of these phones lasted me full days use which often left me without phone late at night this was huge issue when was out late needed uber to contact friends was something wanted to avoid with my next phone purchase loved ios my iphone six was still working fine minus awful battery life after reading some reviews on iphone decided to look into android phones due to mediocre battery reviews s8 had good reviews for battery life although not best for verizon models moto play but it had best reviews for almost everything else which swayed me best buy also had deal going on when purchased it that made it same price per month as moto z2 play that made decision to buy it much easier user interface is easy to use highly customizable screen is amazing it comes with gigs of storage my last phone had so this was huge for me battery life is incredible ve tried it on two main battery settings high mid both lasted me at least full day my first day with high use heavy downloading on full power lasted me from 8a-1a with over left on mid battery saver mode it had over half battery left ve ended up around on full power since that first day all days referenced were around hours use my phone pretty heavily see biggest drops on apps like reddit groupme youtube phone also charges very quickly never could play games on my last two phones due to storage ve downloaded few including final fantasy all run very smoothly it kind of blowing my mind that one of my favorite playstation games can run so well on phone edge to edge display is as advertised it first thing that draws you in in-store pressure sensitive home button is great ve had no issues even when using glass screen protector finger print sensor is also located in place that apparently bothering many users but have case that makes it very easy to feel where it is so have no complaints went with clear otterbox symmetry because liked way orchid gray back of phone looks wouldn recommend purchasing one of tempered glass screen protectors they sell due to price love glass protectors because accident prone ve been using protector from amazon tempered glass protectors are all getting panned online but ve had no issues be really nervous using this phone without extra protection in regards to my purchasing experience best buy was great had only upgraded phones in verizon stores since my first phone in high school so going to best buy made me slightly wary associates were all incredibly helpful not pushy at all they actually talked me out of purchases was heavily considering s8 for extra battery very glad passed it was way too big in my hands it wouldn have been worth extra hour two of battery life wouldn end up needing was able to easily add phone on to my monthly plan just like at verizon only at half cost overall can imagine there better phone out right now it most unique fun user experience ve had since my first smart phone
4,this was upgrade from s4 transfer of contacts done in store was incomplete but app found easily transferred all contacts from s4 to s8 camera has some cool features notification sounds are all different than previous phone so there is learning curve love blue color
5,wasn planning on upgrading but price at bb was so great couldn help myself it has been great decision as had s7 this phone has awesome battery so fast love it
4,really enjoy phone wish there was option for no edge screen cracked screen in first two weeks thank goodness it still works because geek squad insurance says can get replacement yet one month so far with shattered screen being held together with screen protector
5,great phone with super camera amazing display but you will have no problem at all using it with one hand very recommended
1,had to switch to verizon for provider due to my location which meant had to buy verizon phone given sale price opted for new s8 have had nothing but problems from day from pop up ads occurring all day all night to muffled voice complaints that sound garbled can be understood went back to best buy on numerous occasions as well as verizon store met with samsung rep no one could fix problems verizon eventually told to return again best buy that must have faulty phone met with manager who at this point knew issues was having since had been there multiple times in 2weeks had phone however arrived on 15th day after purchased phone was told there was nothing that could be done because returns were allowed only up to day despite fact had my receipt had been there trying to get phone fixed numerous times it should have been replaced days after purchased it when went back to best buy first time now have reconditioned s8 phone that verizon sent to me as had to send new one back to verizon best buy did nothing about this issue am now still on payment plan for brand new phone despite fact have reconditioned one still have issues with not being understood sounded muffled garbled periodically am not able to hear person on other end their is few second delay so we end up speaking over each other wish never got this phone
5,have always owned android phone for as long as can remember tried apple iphone did try to give phone chance but it wasn for me went back to galaxy s8 couldn be happier am on my phone lot so love how long battery stays charged
4,galaxy s8 is beautiful phone with few flaws that consumers should be made aware of fingerprint sensor is not in ideal location however it works great for accessing notification menu curved glass also causes screen protectors to not it here to surface very well also big-selling point is bixby but it is not functioning as promised
5,this phone is easy to use looks sleek has amazing screen is several times more powerful than apples new phone apple will probably have this tech on market in about years charge for it you could get all that now at fraction of price
5,phone is easy to use great camera light in weight
5,these continue to be best phone with great features that won arrive on iphone for two versions
5,long battery life fast need case slippery in hands
5,this is my 3rd phone from galaxy line s3 s6 were my 1st 2nd even though first two were perfectly fine performed well this one far out does them it taking me some getting used to not having actual physical home button to get to home screen default location of chrome shortcut button happens to be exactly where my apps button is on my s6 these aren negatives at all edge seems fine although really haven looked at it much yet bixby button function is well placed but haven looked at it much yet either best buy employee was great samsung representative in best buy store was great there are actual official samsung repair centers in select best buy stores didn know this until after purchased my phone so while not negative web site could do better job of letting people browsing samsung devices know that there is such option with that new information in mind decided to switch my phone protection to geek squad plan instead of one offered by my carrier hope never need to use it but am content that can go to best buy store to take care of it excellent phone excellent customer service by both best buy employee samsung representative excellent protection plan option excellent best buy incentive my carrier had none except if traded in my old phone which didn want to do
4,so far have really liked phone upgraded from s7 it has been good transition was concerned about phone being too bulky but its pretty much same size other than height infinity screen curved edges make it hard for cases to fit just right but at least there is lifeproof for it otherwise phone is great it is super fast camera is incredible it almost freaked me out how hd recording is if were to change anything on phone it would be bixby button bixby itself it seems like waste of button space on my phone rather button start google assistant
5,will always buy samsung great phone
5,great good price everything including service was great
5,samsung galaxy s8 is very stylish sleek purchased this phone for week before black friday
4,great camera great video great low light performance lots more storage than my previous 16gb phone love that can add micro sd card curved screen is gimmick that don find that useful but curved screen makes it very difficult to get good screen protector that doesn interfere with touch screen doesn fall off doesn peel up when swiping from edge have had to restart it few times when encounter glitches that make phone hang otherwise phone is great
5,hadn upgraded my phone since galaxy s4 because features such as removable battery even upgraded storage had been taken out because my s4 still was working just fine even to this day only real reason upgraded was because of special deal going on with new s8 figured why not even though those two previously mentioned features are not in new phone it actually hasn impacted me like thought would much more improved battery lasts me few days without charging it leads me to believe it will last me quite while down road also going from 16gb storage to gb storage made me not even need extra sd card anyway interface runs very smoothly screen quality is fantastic it might not be worth going from s7 one up but if you re more than couple models back it worth it
5,had been hesitant to upgrade because s7 didn allow for adding sd card so waited am glad did s8 is great phone very performant really like form factor how it sits in my hand it was huge jump up from my s5 really like new charger usb3 how fast it charges do not have any issues with this phone have owned it now for several months
5,am not very good at using phones all stuff that comes with it however this phone is very easy to maneuver use love emoji selection
4,am really not android girl love my apple iphone but when tried samsung it almost had me switch if your into android phones recommend this phone
5,am loving this new phone camera on both front back are exceptional call quality is great love look feel of this phone screen is just awesome love all new security features on this phone
5,gs8 is very nice premium feeling phone with awesome edge to edge display android operating system runs very smooth camera quality is also quite good
4,phone is easy to use great camera clean pictures applications easier to use
4,liked my phone is overall smooth sturdy but little knock on curved side of screen caused it to crack wish had it cover protected on day one
5,got phone on august 20th so far so good really like phone it durable
5,this phone has amazing camera takes some of best pictures ever absolutely love this phone
5,my samsung galaxy purchase exceeded my expectations there are so many features that even after months continue to learn new things about my phone camera is amazing my photo are best have ever taken with cellphone
4,sleek design love storage capacity fingerprint scanner moving to back of phone lack of home button takes some getting used to
5,coral blue color is stunning exclusive to best buy fans of samsung products android phones will not be disappointed in quality of phone in performance camera imaging functionality apple users this phone will make you want to convert
5,this phone does it all it looks great with it slick form factor there no lag when use it camera is great there ton of shortcuts with hard buttons everything is pretty seamless there nothing you can do with hard button for bixby being there but at least there are apps to change its use have no complaints camera is top notch
5,love this phone but aspect ratio is little weird when watching movie video with screen in landscape orientation there are vertical black bars on both edges of screen this is minor issue but it worth mentioning great battery life unlock features iris scan is really cool works surprisingly well
4,great upgrade from my s5 which has been feeling slow clunky nice slim phone awesome screen lots of new features
4,s8 is very good cell phone camera takes nice pictures display is sharp clear accessing web pages is rapid having many sites open at same time is no problem my main complaint is that when button keyboard character displays at edge of screen trying to get item to display may require several touches due to curvature of screen edge of screen is good for display purposes but awkward for input
3,this is great phone but curved edges are not asset buttons near edges are tricky to push due to curve options for covers to protect phone are also limited due to curved screen require glass screen protector which makes keys less sensitive cover that does not come up around edge of screen to protect it in case of fall
5,this phone is fast has huge memory looks great with curved edges it takes while to get used to fact that there no physical home button but on-screen button works just as well if you hold that area where button for 1-2 seconds while screen is off it turns on screen just like it would with physical home button great product overall
3,enjoy my galaxy phone but camera is hard to work with protective case over it my internet signal is worse than my galaxy
5,read reviews before purchased this phone have to say that this is best phone out in my opinion ve had it for almost weeks now still learning new things battery life is amazing on this phone got body glove case but no screen protector as it really difficult to find one that works with curved screen case only things hate are curved screen size volume really wish samsung would have made flat screen made screen inches instead of inches because believe that sweet spot not too big not too small also wish samsung had provided louder speaker maybe duel speakers at bottom one in ear piece like iphone these are minor issues not enough to lose star over but just believe if these things were done it really would be perfect phone in my opinion
4,still learning all new features no problems at this point other than curved screen doesn take glass protector shield very well will look at flexible plastic protector to see if it any better
5,this phone is definitely way smarter than am am still finding out features but user interface is great it beautiful product only knock give it is that on speaker phone mode for calls it tends to cut out
5,upgraded to s8 from s5 with no hesitation once knew phone had qualcomm chip it was between s8 sony xperia premium s8 had slim profile better screen to body ratio screen resolution was not deal changer since it just phone not tv great quality phone that fast have been using face recognition with back up pin to unlock phone face recognition doesn register as often as like to trouble shoot this go change your picture in unlock settings to common position you typically gold to unlock your phone recommend playing with your picture as you ll see when phone takes it but overall great buy interested in bixby release
5,this product has very few noticeable changes from s7 except now it has curved screen wasn really in favor of this feature my s7 was great phone assume this will be too time will tell
5,it feels very sleek way better upgrade from s6 it feels good but would recommend case
1,traded in s7 bought s8 s7 worked perfectly with prius s8 only notifies car of phone calls but not messages email intend to return it wish could get my old s7 back s8 far inferior to s7 basically unusable for me when driving this is known issue on samsung user boards
5,phone is amazing sleek it has very ressponsive interface very comfortable design for 1-handed 2-handed use only complaint have is location of bixby button this is samsung version of seri button is located right below volume on left side of phone can easily be pressed on accident which gets annoying best buy service was great during my purchase was handled very smoothly in timely manner
5,happy with phones overall performance outperforms expectations
4,beautiful feels nice performs well so far it is still new but it is very nice we are quite pleased with it so far speedy very nice display feels great
5,nice phone curved screen is great for pics but bit of pain to put screen protector on inductive charging is great too great upgrade to older galaxy models
1,known fragility issues screens case are cracking with without dropping with protective cases screen protectors do your research have always loved galaxy phones but this one is different buyer beware
5,best buy had very best deal on samsung ive had no issues with this phone highly recommend it
5,was on fence between iphone samsung samsung clearly is better because android allows me to customize my phone to my needs battery life is great
4,have to say that this phone has been good upgrade compared to other phones its not loud phone but its decent really like display battery life different features it has another good thing it has not frozen yet am still getting used to edge which makes it hard to find good screen protector for it overall its nice job done by samsung great deal with best buy
4,loved phone more features than could handle phone was little narrow for my liking coming from s5 display was nice sharp overall phone was really nice to use had it for about days before returned it only down side to phone was charging adapter phone does not use standard samsung charging connection but instead you have to use tiny adapter on all your cords that is only reason gave it four out of five stars returned it for s7 edge
5,best buy is much more helpful than corporate version store was ll never set foot in verizon again
5,extremely happy with this phone bought it on black friday deal offering off couldn be happier battery life of this phone is phenomenal am avid phone user social media snapchat texting spotify etc this battery lasts me hours this is first phone have ever owned that lasts me entirety of day even with how frequently use it screen is beautiful display is next-level extremely impressed so glad chose this over iphone got this phone after already owning galaxy best buy transferred everything from my old phone in minutes this phone is best purchase have made in long time

5,s8 is my first android phone have been iphone user for past years was getting sick of apple way of being best but not really wanted something new change of pace s8 was phone was looking for display is stunning phone has multitude of capabilities however there are few shortfalls to phone first is that android technology does not incorporate percentage indicator for bluetooth devices while this may seem picky one does not like their headphones dieing on them in middle of great workout secondly bluetooth is not what it cracked up to be my iphone had much longer range for its bluetooth could play my wireless speaker in basement while standing on my first floor it would be clear s8 breaks up as soon as go to second floor overall great phone but needs some improvement
4,cellphone itself is very impressive by its look it screen
5,reviews claiming this is best phone available are probably true phone is more advanced than this user only irritant is screen often covers back arrow at bottom so you always have to move screen edge up to show arrow fairly irritating

5,am iphone person recently moved to samsung which has great features

4,have loved samsung phones for while now this one is no different only thing miss had note5 before is pen but water resistant is very nice
5,battery life is much better than my previous galaxy my only complaint is that since it is edge phone you need to buy separate glass protection film most don fit correctly but overall happy with my phone

5,this phone is wonderful very responsive easy to use
5,what can say that hasn already been said echo all positives with this phone battery life is big improvement over my previous s4 stepping up onboard storage to 64gb is welcome relief 16gb is not enough today app sizes curved screen looks cool is surprisingly less annoying than was expecting it to be but still can be difficult to navigate when swiping from edge of screen from time to time dragging to pull up full screen notifications my biggest complaint is non-standard non-16 aspect ratio for phone nice for reading articles pain for watching video casting your screen to monitor car stereo wish they would include option to cast to traditional aspect ratio
4,phone is fast as expected but screen is not up to par bought bi-fold type phone screen protector phone is weeks old credit card in bi-fold slot has scratched phone screen screens are not impressive will scratch easily you better get screen protector you will be sorry

5,great phone very sleek works well love purple color headphones are awesome too
5,samsung galaxy is proving to be awesome phone simple to use fast
5,screen is so clear bigger then my old phone love detail in it
5,my new samsung galaxy is awesome love it it is taking while to get use to new up down to find everything but it is well worth it
5,ive had phone for about momths now with absolutely no problems love it
4,love my phone but wish it was little bit smaller
5,bought he samsung specifically for it photo abilities it hasn let me down it has lot of features which haven even began to explore but my favorite feature is camera it also let you shoot in raw was really surprised to get such greay fireworks photos grom hnd holding this camera just set it on auto it does rest you can even review camera settings after you take pic
5,not one to purchase latest tech but rather older versions however received no-brainer deal from best buy to get this phone with verizon plan this phone does everything as expected performs well fast processing great visuals also enjoy storage space because listen to lot of music podcasts maintain many files my only negatives are as follows very slippery screen fades out to sides sometimes cuts images buttons off bit headjack is on bottom which tends to get in my way in exercising holding too often little things like screen not transitioning when turned upside down that may be in settings that haven found yet
5,after being frustrated with note but fan of samsung decided couldn pass up deal on s8 awesome phone style look function
5,changed from iphone to this don regret it at all
5,love camera size of phone if you are not fan of apple you re looking for quality this is it
4,samsung is nice phone not too bulky easy to use
4,it seems to do everything that expect it to do enjoy learning all new things it does really like camera has great pictures
5,like phone lot very good screen camera quality
5,had s7 edge previously s8 has some great additions
5,bought new phone for my wife she loves speed of phone long battery life
5,love this phone great item great price easy set up
4,found it easy to use after having previous phone for so long
5,this cellular phone came highly recommended by family member it would be easer for me been it is large than my current phone
5,love speed ease of use finally upgraded from galaxy s4
5,best phone have ever had tons of features very easy to deal with
5,best phone ever hold so far loaded with features camera speaker are amazing
5,had been wanting to upgrade for sometime this one was worth wait great phone
5,s8 is much faster has better camera allows use of sd card which s6 lacked
5,this phone was released at launch from best buy with incentive free virtual reality headset as months have passed they ve continued offers to purchase phone at discount with bundle packs this was great reason to buy from bb phone was available exactly when specified when preordered pick up procedure as well as coordination to receive headset were seamless highly recommended best phone ve ever had
4,love phone just amazing would recommend to my friends family
4,ve had s8 for about month it has many improved features am disappointed in more complicated method for screen mirroring
5,this phone is awesome camera takes great pictures
5,love samsung for its galaxy series this is no exception love display camera quality performance can wait for next in line
5,phone is amazing love features style overall great phone would definitely recommend
5,nice sleek easy to use just not crazy about screen curved corners
5,upgraded from galaxy gs4 to gs8 mainly because of memory limitations of gs4 this phone is way more versatile that gs4 it can handle more that one email account under same email button they are super easy to switch between syncs better with my moto gen smart watch than gs4 did has access to better apps that automatically appear on watch once they are installed on phone have not used camera much yet but am looking forward to that as well as camera on gs4 was lacking
5,love this phone its fast camera is fantastic battery live is just fine solid package
5,it awesome super fast battery life is amazing don like bixby popping up but will figure out how to disable it eventually
2,this phone has some great features but if it is broken it is worthless after other smartphones that were easy to protect with cases screen protectors this one was difficult what dealer doesn tell you is that edge screen is so fragile that dropping it just one time will break it that being said it is hard to find case that will protect edge it is also hard to find screen protector made of glass that will fit properly give same touch ability they should stress that you must have insurance then you probably will have to pay service fee camera is great storage great battery life so so don count on bixby to be reliable it doesn always come up when you want it to sometimes starts talking when phone is sitting idle if it had flat screen would recommend it but not with edge never again
5,was getting irritated with my iphone running out of space no more galaxy to rescue now have same amount of apps photos music on my device plus more haven even touched half of space
5,while loved my s7 new s8 is better better quality camera glass display speed ease of use make this new upgrade well worth it camera is incredible
5,upgraded to this from my note it about same thing but with better specs all around would necessarily say this is worth upgrading if you have working phone but if you re in need of upgrade this is great choice still not on board with curved edges but everything else is up to par
5,this phone is much better then sound screen are nice
5,got two of galaxy s8 over weekend love it
4,cool phone but do not like edge screen it to hard to type if you have big hands
5,ve never used such beautiful phone before had it for almost month no issues so far love when bevels light up for notifications camera is great although sometimes struggles with capturing contrast between sky ground but all phone cameras seem to struggle with that no regrets
5,upgraded from s6 to s8 don regret it at all s8 has been all that it has lived up to everything you hear about product phone was purchased for my son he does everything that you can do with phone so if he is happy with it says lot
5,slim light excellent display camera better than apple
5,finally got my new phone ve been waiting for new product that can love so many features for galaxy still learning but really enjoying so far
5,my brother loves his new he said pretty much every feature is better than he just had
5,we got new s8 for my wife her s4 was shot she is enjoying new phone everything works as it should call quality is very nice screen looks great phone is very fast
2,best buy promotes coral blue with case but it wasn available in store they don compensate in any way it took two hours to buy this phone transfer data from old phone guy was new was getting no help from other workers milling around as far as phone not everything auto rotates messenger doesn have pinch feature to increase font size finding what your looking for in settings is frustrating
5,amazing
4,old phone died all of sudden found out that they are only designed to last couple years don know if this is any better don know yet
5,upgraded my verizon phone from s6 haven been sorry my carrier didn have any incentives in any of their locations online but best buy sure did they also have samsung pro on site that facilitated my upgrade great best buy service great samsung service
1,dropped my s8 while pulling it out of my pocket screen shattered so bad it is not usable two repair shops quoted for screen replacement plus two week wait guess samsung cant get enough screens shipped out fast enough only had phone for days interweb is full of s8 owners who have had same problem if you dont mind extra month it is fantastic phone
4,decided to switch from apple this is huge upgrade from my iphone phone is bit tall even with my long fingers it can be hard to reach top haven found email app that like as much as apple email other than that really like it having full keyboard is great screen is incredible definitely takes some getting used to as have never used android device before so far glad switched
5,never had samsung phone before however did have iphone for some time galaxy s8 is huge upgrade you can customize so many different features on phone still learn something new each day camera takes excellent photos fingerprint scanner location is not as bad as everyone thinks it might be only con have about phone is inability to put it to sleep turn screen off without letting screen time out by pressing side power button once just installed new update it has definitely made infinity screen even more amazing there is also bixby feature am still little skeptical about bixby so haven really been using it didn have s7 so can speak for those who want immediate upgrades but if you have version before that would highly recommend upgrading even if you re iphone user who wants change samsung galaxy s8 is great phone if you have any questions about phone feel free to ask
5,had phone for about months now they work great
5,had phone for about months now they work great
5,product was fine individual that helped me didn seem very detail oriented sure of what he was doing
5,bought this phone as part of my transition to google ecosystem phone works great
2,really wanted to love this phone design is beautiful camera is beyond fantastic but cons outweigh pros microphone speaker is absolute garbage don have bluetooth in my car rely heavily on quality of speaker though it was good for playing music every call was on person on other end could not hear word said ended up having to use cell handheld not so safe sound silent modality couldn easily figure out how to have timer alarm go off when phone was on silent vibrate mode no good accessories ordered about different screen protectors cases off of amazon from reputable companies none seemed to work with phone battery life battery was generally great except for when using gps then battery drained within few hours it just not as great as expected it to be my disappointing purchase turned into return better pay restocking fee than continue paying for impractical phone
5,this is best phone available if you want to know what two iphones from now will be like get this
5,went back to samsung after having motorola am so glad did this phone has great picture is so easy to use love it
5,picked up second s8 for our account best buy had it on sale it was almost half of price paid at product launch s8 has excellent battery which lasts over full day with medium usage display is awesome

2,overall all like phone but bluetooth connection is horrible have devices powerbeats2 bluetooth speaker my vehicle that my s5 worked very well with since switching to s8 all devices now have horrible connections bluetooth range is horrible with my speaker headphones when further than feet from device when calling people from my truck person am calling only hears static only hear complete silence on my end truck is brand new there were no connection problems between my s5 truck returned to store they exchanged s8 for new one however new s8 is doing all same things will be returning phone checking out other brands

5,upgraded from galaxy s5 this phone has ton of great new features along with sleek interface definitely would recommend
4,upgraded to from it has lot of same features so it was easy to adjust to like smart transfer feature good phone overall only complaint is battery have to charge it every night
5,this phone it great call clarity ease of use battery life look feel are all wonderful on gripe have besides obvious poor placement of fingerprint scanner right next to camera seriously is weird screen aspect ratio tall thin phone screen often places vertical bars on either side of viewable screen when watching movie video in landscape mode what point of infinity screen if you re no using all of that space also curved edges of phone can sometimes make it hard to use horizontal scroll on webpage use some video player features because scroll bar buttons are displayed on curved edge in landscape mode don always pick up your finger presses overall this is great looking performing phone but these two minor issues can be annoying
5,was in need of new phone still had s4 s8 is great easy to use tons of features
4,it dandy am very happy with screen it is easier to use can customize product more to my liking it is durable all good things
5,fast beautiful design not bogged down with bloatware apps that work

5,it is all anyone would want in phone it does it all
5,ui camera are nice improvement over s6

5,wife loves it enough said close to edge that was her favorite

5,my first phone that is most current version lovely screen very good looking pics videos works well with no problems so far
4,great quality all around screen size quality is great picture quality is fantastic
5,what can say this android smart phone is best ve own on market to-date phone displays crisp picture produces good sound for such small device camera takes unbelievable pictures oh it has awesome battery life too
5,only complaint is trying to find case screen cover
5,pretty easy to use love speed more apps to use too
5,like most everyone today have used several varieties of smartphones over years iphones lg moto am really impressed with quality of s8 overall pleasure get from using it everything feels seamless display is gorgeous understand that phone is covered in glass coating so bought wallet case that keeps entire phone covered when not in use not huge user of fingerprint scanner don even care to try bixby so can really comment on those aspects enjoy customization of android s8 is cream of crop in android market my wife has iphone which is fantastic phone but with screen headphones android functionality feel s8 is superior device
5,really loving this phone like having bigger screen than my old phone but it still easy to hold have have small hands some of bigger phones are difficult for me to use one handed but not this one beautiful high resolution screen is easy on my eyes runs fast smooth
5,this is my 4th galaxy phone features keep getting better picture quality is amazing even in low light perfect size holds charge all day
5,great phone nice upgrade from gs6 battery life is good phone is her responsive 4k screen is beautiful no complaints just wanting nice glass screen protector so far no one makes full adhesive protector

4,love it team android works great love advancements
5,decided to upgrade from s5 it is so much faster it is really nice bought two that day apple screen is fantastic everything exceeds what want it for
4,love full screen interface its got good weight even without case it grippy enough to not slip out your hand that easy like aluminum back phones speaker is surprisingly loud it takes beautiful pictures even pointed at clouds time will tell if any quirks flaws pop up like my previous phone you know how this game goes
5,this is second of two galaxy s8 phones purchased my wife loves it it larger screen than old galaxy s4 we had but much better quality images having little larger screen is great we ve had no problems with either phone would definitely buy again glad we waited so long for upgrade because this is great phone
5,takes little getting used to new os because of upgrade from old galaxy s4 but overall very happy with phone thought curved edges might be problem but ve experienced no issues with anything accidentally happening when touch edge
5,best phone had so far still need to get used to it
5,switch back from iphone again cz my iphone 6s got crash screen times in row during past half year s8 is durable solid build much better than iphone throw away my phone occasionally result is s8 survived but iphone broke everytime good speed okay battery nice design
4,ve been loyal samsung customer for several years now love this phone coming from s7 edge this phone is thinner lighter not so bulky originally got s8 it ended up being too big so exchanged it shouldn need to use guy sized hands to hold phone at times battery life is pretty good little better than s7 have orchid gray one looks gray blue silver light purple at times who picks colors for these phones anyway anyway camera is amazing it is fast call quality is really good definitely recommend
5,had s6 before this can honestly say samsung outdid themselves again great battery life very fast couldn ask for better phone because don know what they could improve on
4,over time hoping samsung galaxy s8 becomes five star product it obviously has glorious screen features galore apprehensive about durability of screen based on other reviews ll update my post in six months so
5,best phone samsung has made ease of use great camera
5,love this phone still exploring all features great camera easy to use love screen size battery life is good
5,like it but still learning about all it does in time will say more
5,this phone is light years ahead of my tracfone having been playing pokemon go doing all kinds texting taking pix love it love it love it
5,wanted to upgrade my samsung s5 wow what change love bigger screen clarity of picture this was great purchase
4,love phone it much better than my galaxy s5 however curved glass which looks nice is terrible feature had phone two days it is very thin put it in my back pocket sat down on chair cracked glass cost to replace glass is phone cost so disappointed in design would give phone five stars if it wasn for this curved glass which will lead to cracks want on several samsung galaxy s8 forums there are thousands of people complaining about glass cracking am going to recommend phone to friend with caveat be careful with glass get case that complete covers front of phone there aren many cases out there that do
4,really like this phone screen is incredible-both clear large headphones that come with it are outstanding quality multiple security options are pretty impressive albeit almost too much had heard some negative things regarding bixby assistant software but think it works well my only knock on it so far is back casing being pretty scratch prone haven had phone long it shows some of hairline scratches now in market for protective case when hoped to not need one thinking purely for condition for trade in value overall would have no hesitation buying this phone over over again samsung has stepped up their game once again
3,phone screen cracked when in my pocket should have read reviews that said it was very easy to crack
5,am enjoying my new samsung galaxy s8 it feels so sleek
5,am very happy with my new samsung s8 which recently upgraded from s7 overall slimmer width fits better in hand screen resolution is even better than s7

4,replaced my old s5 that finally crapped out phone is awesome display takes up entire screen which is real bonus phone also retains headphone jack as it is my primary music device camera produces great photos with very good call clarity my only complaints are fingerprint scanner is next to camera lens in back of camera poor design face recognition rarely works
5,didn know what was missing with my galaxy s5 but new galaxy s8 is awesome this battery fully charges in to hours it lasts for days more with normal use even if take lot of photos watch videos it easily lasts hours it so nice to have gb of ram built-in plus micro sd slot for expanded memory which use for my photos videos it allows me to run lots of apps at same time without slowing down phone at all new retinal scanner is nice because can unlock my phone in public place without anyone seeing my unlock pin pattern it only works with my own eyes very cool phone

5,love battery endurance quick charge sound quality is great as are pictures had moto droid that did not like at all turned it in for this s8 am now very happy with my phone
4,have just had my galaxy s8 for two weeks there are many things like about phone such as quality features of camera curved screen is to me not good design when there are items icons text etc that have to be touched that are on edge of screen it can be difficult to have item respond to touch also moving app shortcut from one page to another by holding finger on it sliding it can be difficult as when one gets to edge it often doesn want to move to adjacent screen also installed some files on phone as there was no documents my documents folder samsung customer service advised to create folder documents did installed files couple of days later files disappeared my documents folder appeared had to move files to phone again also folder installed doesn show up when access documents but files sub-folders do show up many of functions of phone have improved considerably over my former galaxy note
5,so far like it takes some time to get use to home button not as bulky as screen has got me little worried but ll just have to be careful with it
5,great step up from my old galaxy nice features speed
5,have had several samsung phones all great experiences when noticed my not-quite two year old s5 slowing down really using up battery figured it was time to make s8 mine did this on high recommendation from my 8th grade students who were as usual right on tech money am thrilled with battery life ease of use overall operation of s8 so glad made purchase which did right at best buy even got trade in credit from my s5 samsung crew at best buy were super all of my other samsung purchases were at verizon brick store would definitely buy again

5,just left my s6 for this awesome new upgraded techy phone love battery life super fast processor water proofness always been android fan
5,we had to get new phone when our old one died before big trip fortunately verizon had backed up our apps all contacts with groups so we were completely put back together after salesman moved our sd card with all our pictures some apps to new phone another samsung person at bestbuy had moved all our pictures some apps those that could be moved to mini sd card few months ago hint you have to use file manager instead of gallery to move pictures apps very happy with verizon bestbuy samsung
5,this is sleekest looking overall best camera have ever used this phones display is amazing
5,good battery life lasts all day phone had before didn last half as long
5,was upgrading from galaxy s6 main reason was to get phone with better battery than s6 well this one is it usually had to charge my s6 more than once day so far with s8 it has been lasting all day with one charge
5,easy purchase through best buy impressive phone voice quality battery life glad picked this up
3,mp rear camera 8mp front camera are excellent battery life holds out strong easy to use set up has excellent display although have some concerns purchased otterbox defender case for it since both front rear of phone is glass glass gets easily smudged don feel confident holding phone as if it ll slip out of my hand ve read many reviews that without strong case glass on either side of phone could chip break fingerprint sensor also takes bit to work out since it doesn get my fingerprint quite right until few more attempts overall it good phone but definitely buy strong durable case for it else it prone to being chipped cracked bixby button also is annoying since accidentally press it lot
5,was worried at first about not having home button but got used to having it on screen pretty quickly love camera it takes amazing pictures both front rear facing also like having fingerprint sensor on back of phone
5,great option for new phone upgrade savings on my plan
5,love my new galaxy s8 camera features are great very clear pictures videos edge features are super easy to use too would encourage others to get this phone
5,had samsung note this phone had almost same size screen in smaller package sharp pictures images
4,start by saying got s8 because needed new phone have had galaxy since s3 which was my favorite version of this phone s8 has made some great improvements however one area that they samsung have preached is bixby yesterday my bixby finally had voice can understand some basic voice inputs phone was released without bixby fully functional that is minus one star outside of that great phone would argue for most of us phone is top-notch just find it annoying it was released not fully functional
5,got this phone you my son he loves his as much as love mine we got them together he said it best samsung phone he had so far great quality great color graphics
5,love this phone color graphics are amazing crystal clear bright color camera is also amazing excellent pictures love bixby she is so awesome
4,would recommend this item go ahead get it
4,good phone for my mother she love android devices
5,it is perfect phone for me long battery life fast able to have more memory with sd card it isn humungous device have to lug around
5,has so many bells whistles that months after getting it am still finding cool new things about phone
5,galaxy is best phone ive had so far when it comes to cellphones
5,did6want to upgrade glad did very nice phone
4,have always been iphone guy was looking for change of pace dediced to give this phone try design of this phone is fantastic large screen in not so large phone very nice phone on other hand if new iphone is basically same design as galaxy will be going back to apple am very simple guy like simple phone simplicity reliability are my two biggest wants android phones have way to many bells whistles that just don need
5,love my new samsung galaxy s8 upgraded from galaxy s3 yes you read that right s3 to new samsung s8 huge upgrade for me in all years that had owned s3 since never had problem it so knew that once price dropped on s8 would purchase one it was so worth wait my new s8 is like mini computer crystal clear screen takes great photos has so many awesome features ve had it for week can seem to put it down if you are on fence go for it you won be disappointed
4,like phone because it is easy to use has ton more memory than my previous phone
5,its new s8 that my daughter got for 16th birthday my wife got few months back as equally impressed love samsung pay camera finally no more physical home button its beautiful screen but hate that screen is over exposed screen protectors have hard time staying on all glass to needs case though am watching shows on drama fever no one uses case for promotional purposes but still flip case does nice job of protecting screen when not in use but still vulnerable when being used
2,screen is not consistently sensitive with protective glass on also appears to be less sensitive on edges didn like google play app for my music so downloaded samsung app has tendency to drop public radio app like to listen to bluetooth connection to car is inconsistent occasionally turns off bluetooth have had to contact samsung several times to get help they have been very helpful best buy folks have also been helpful bright clear screen haven played much with bixby biometric iris thumbprint login work well
5,wife wanted galaxy s8 she absolutely in love with it iphone guy myself but it works for her what she does for work
5,couldn beat deal great phone at great price from great store
4,have been very happy with this phone so far it big step up from s5
5,glad they upoed storage is now water proof
5,getting to know s8 since upgraded from s4 do not like 1st screen always showing volume for not high enough for people to head me very well
5,display is beautiful it everything could ever want in phone
4,great phone with nice screen resolution good camera but phone locked up on me within first two days requiring soft reboot had to find out how to reboot on line found several others are having similar issues hopefully it won happen again great price at best buy good service to get old phone transferred over new phone up running
5,would definitely recommend this phone buying another one to add on my plan
5,love my new samsung phone sleek shiny sophisticated very user friendly fast too
4,traded edge camera is better but nothing else is that exciting good phone so far
5,am very satisfied with my purchase it is also plus that bestbuy offers samsung experience within store this makes it so efficient if there are any questions about product
5,very happy with this phone quite upgrade from s5
5,this was purchased for my son after his s6 died one month shy of years old he loves this phone with all of its new features such as edge always on display retinal scan bixby expansion sd slot improved performance camera movies don look like they are on phone more like tiny 4k television solid construction flawless operation great phone
5,love phone it is exactly what want great product
5,love galaxy s8 it charges fast has better reception photos are great easy to get to know loved my s7 but love this more
3,samsung galaxy s8 is very good-looking phone it operates well so have no complaints about its operation however see some shortcomings in its design prospective buyer should consider yes these are not very serious complaints but they are nonetheless annoyances hadn considered when bought phone curved edges of display work poorly with tempered glass protectors ve used rather than gluing entire tempered screen protector to phone screen screen protector has its glue applied only to its perimeter this means that moisture can get between protector screen glue-line is visible when looking at screen edge this also makes phone is less responsive to touch in some areas of screen because of inconsistent air gap between screen protector furthermore screen isn protected as well at curved edges because protective case must allow you to see side of screen this lack of edge protection allowed short drop to shatter phone screen when very edge hit ground lack of home key makes determining which end of phone is up more difficult yes you can see camera speaker are at top but it takes more than casual glance at phone to figure things out regret trading in my galaxy s6 getting s8
5,as get used to s8 find that am liking it much better than s5 had before samsung reps in store were very helpful in transferring data from my old phone
5,we bought this phone for our daughter she is delighted with speed compared to her galaxy s6
5,have now been samsung convert for several generations starting with s5 this is sleek well-designed phone very responsive love camera ability to have dslr like controls am always amazed at quality of low light pictures this camera can take
5,this is by far best phone have ever owned very easy to use
5,was well behind overdue for upgrade screen resolution picture quality is great wasn sure would use edge feature but find use all time fast charging is awesome battery life is long bit getting used to change for no home button to on screen one different way to close all apps took few days to get used to new features have to remind myself went from s3 to s8 plus s3 finally died which prompted purchase glad went to s8 plus over other phones overall very pleased with purchase
4,love it upgraded from samsung s6 so glad made that decision
5,lightweight easy to use good camera clear images
5,samsung galaxy s8 phone is magnificent upgrade from my s4 phone only have to recharge phone every days instead of twice day having fun learning new features there are so many good ones
5,love this phone it features it keeps charge all day
5,debated between s8 s8 decided on s8 because of smaller size ease of use with my small hands easy transition from my old phone
5,this s8 is just right size for my hand can finally reach across screen with my thumb to tap application icon screen resolution is amazing ve used samsung for many years this is best one yet
5,first phone for kid couldn have been better choice out there includes best buy card worth bucks perfect

4,like phone size wise this was as big as was going to go many phones were bigger think some of those would be like holding laptop up to your ear put cover on phone to protect edges guess don want to find out how strong glass is as far as factory software apps are concerned there is some good stuff prefer android like this version don care for bixby maybe it ll grow on me overall this was good choice for me
5,phone is great all around only complaints are that samsung ui is little limiting has decent amount of bloatware also ir remote present in previous samsung phones was removed know not lot of people use this but really enjoyed being able to have full control over my home entertainment system with my phone

5,this is actually my wife phone but she really loves her new galaxy s8 functionality quality upgrade from her old galaxy s6 is amazing vivid quality of pictures videos is nice improvement
4,my perspective is based on being early adopter for s6 edge was really looking for something little smaller with essentially same look feel this fits bill add improved display less bezel sd card capability improved battery happy camper it took little getting used to to have fingerprint sensor on back but now it second hand to go there there are still things want to acquaint myself with but so far enjoying phone quite bit
3,have had s8 for about month not sure why everyone says these phones have better photos between it phone but don see it there are no photo modes to speak of night shots outdoor shots are not nearly as good as previous versions but even those were not as good as phone taking photos next to me spell correct apps that are standard are not nea let as good as my older version everything harder to use wish bought stripped down phone to put on apps want sure wish could find old contact app old phone app th ese are terrible same with message app
3,phone has great features camera is awesome only problem have is durability sucks have had my phone for month screen is already cracked have screen protector on it too didn even drop it it was falling off of my countertop caught up against edge of counter so disappointed it cost too much money to be so fragile
4,this was my boyfriend choice of phone for his upgrade from samsung galaxy s5 he really likes it he says it fits really well in his hand it also came with free wireless charging pad one thing that weird is usb charger which is different shape than other chargers we have so can borrow it to use with my son kindle fire tablet my samsung gs7 phone but think he likes it that way

5,would recommend this phone it took little bit to get use to it but it is easier every day

5,great so far no problems at all very similar functionality to s5 it replaced
5,am enjoying my new samsung phone it is similar to samsung thus it is not hard to learn how it works have been able to figure out some kinks
5,few things that didn read anything about in reviews that found personally useful after week you can designated trusted sites so your phone doesn always lock if your in those spots hated having to unlock my iphone every time was driving which is very often fingerprint reader was fickle s8 knows when in my car home my office so it doesn require me to unlock it in those places that nice feature message app not sure it actually samsung app but might be actually from verizon has some additional tricks in it over stock iphone text app never used some other apps if there was stock apple one so not sure that available on both phones anyway level of customization is almost silly but if you want to really personalize almost every aspect then you can one down side is that texting features in apple are still better with ability to add emoticons emoji miss being able to draw things like iphone up can do smoothness of whole phone makes dropping it concern don really like cases what point of developers spending money on physical phone if it covered up but also don want to drop thing because it summer my had gets sweaty from holding it in sun overall adjusting to being in apple free phone world it working just fine with promise of working great
4,good solid phone very similar to previous samsung phones getting used to edge component don completely like it but don completely hate it either aspect ratio of screen is odd with ultra long height condensed width not greatest for viewing video phone is very slippery dropped it twice within few days so would recommend purchasing case that offers some traction
5,still learning all things it can do had s4 so this is big upgrade fro me
4,best buy associate was sloppy entering data to switch to s8 he put wrong from my account so no calls for week until knew about incorrect account
5,my wife has s8 have s8 screen size isn obviously bigger but my wife smaller hands likes s8 mine prefer s8
5,nice new features find myself using just one hand more so than on my previous samsung phones
5,switching from samsung galaxy note to galaxy s8 was bit hesitant did not want to lose my stylus nor did want to lose smoothness of my note after doing tons of research decided to give s8 try will say it did not let me down s8 is everything reviews say more only downfall is missing my stylus but with all other features it has it makes up for it being water resistant bringing back sd slot was also plus have tons of space front-facing camera takes better pictures than any phone ve had previously navigation bar is amazing battery life has been extended will say phone can get hot when you are using is none stop while it plugged in but it did not mess with functioning of phone at all highly recommend this phone am blown away by it

4,this is bit difficult to get used to after note because size is smaller but it is easier to put in pocket one issue is home button right below space bar when typing often hit home button instead of space bar kind of miss physical home button there are some very nice updates
4,really like samsung line of phones this prove to be very good upgrade from my samsung only feature really question is finger print being on back it seems to be little trickier to use then when it was on front of phone one of main things like about samsung is samsung pay that can be used at just about any store iphone other androids are limited at this time only place it has not worked is at gas pumps

5,have not had new phone in years am really enjoying this one
5,so far my experience with galaxy s8 has been as expected perfect screen great response great sound great camera hoping that everything continues to go smoothly only thing that don like about it is bixby button
4,our old samsung s5s were on way out--time to buy new ones in this case s8 seems much same as s5 but bigger nicer camera rounded edges are tricky however--my wife s8 is stiffer when trying to touch tap things near edge mine is better in that regard area it may be zagg glass screen protector battery life is excellent also it is hard to access settings function other icons that appear at top--i think that is zagg too all things equal it is good phone
5,phone is slick has easy grip even for plus amazing purchase if you are in market for new phone search is over
5,love phone all it can do very happy very satisfied
4,first phone kept dropping internet connections but after calling verizon twice they said it was probably hardware took it back to bb within exchange period they swapped it out new one is working good
3,nice slim but slippery broke in first week
5,we got of these for my wife my teenage kids everybody loves this phone
5,this is absolute breath of fresh air not that am against apple just thought that samsung deserved competitive chance before consecutive upgrades in apple world learning curve is significantly more intense than i-phone but it is not rocket science
3,when asking for phone to respond to verbal questions google bixby responds with very fast speed occasionally when took it back they said that maybe sim card was bad but just got phone within last two weeks they replaced it it happened again also my samsung got better reception than this one

4,this is my third android smartphone have never owned iphone but ve used them often galaxy s8 is great phone for watching videos taking pictures browsing internet facebook but ve had increasingly difficult time playing some games on it due to buttons on edges of screen being very hard to press have pretty average to small fingers but it still challenging sometimes requiring me to reposition my finger dozens of times that is my only complaint really wish they had s8 that wasn edge because play games it is awful for them

4,getting used to edge screen how sensitive screen is when typing only have had week no problems
5,this phone is awesome software is best it ever been experience is smooth ve not ran into any issues love that it is water dust proof would buy case all glass body will not hold up well against concrete
3,phone performs as expected from other reviews phone is slippery requires case nearly all cases in store obscure specialty color of case
5,larger very clear screen fast updating retrieval of data
5,love this phone it definitely been unboxed camera is great still getting used to bixby though havent completely gotten hang of everything this phone offers yet but am excited to keep playing with it find out

5,had all samsung phones this one is absolutely best camera is amazing quality of pictures are awesome
4,great upgrades on this compared to s7 which also have every new phone just gets better better just doesn stop wish they would come out with different backing for phone since glass seems little to breakable you have to cover most of it up just to protect it from breaking so easily
5,listen to me samsung has outdone themselves with gs8 screen is best ve seen on cellular device give it stars on ease of use front camera is very much improved great sound from onboard speaker would definitely recommend this phone to any android ios user
5,this purchase was for my husband he loves it he told me he wanted to be buried with it he has really enjoyed it ease of use new features our old galaxies didn have he loves camera
5,love orchid grey color phones sleek look it does everything my old galaxy did then some beautiful pics
5,great phone very responsive to touch quick to charge wonderful screen
5,love it lots of new features for me since it upgraded from samsung
5,purchased this phone on april 22nd right after it was available love love love it if you ve had galaxy before this is must have it best one yet well worth price
5,my mom needed upgrade for her phone but didn want anything that wasn going to be durable hold up we read reviews spoke to people after whole minutes going over product in person she decided to buy has loved it ever since highly recommend phone to someone
4,mine broke when it slipped out of my shirt pocket fell total of two feet onto its edge shattered works but essentially useless had no insurance warranty doesn cover breakage now have second one for full retail works great but now have protector which ve never had before full insurance plan for two years call me stupid love phone it works great still rather have this than apple but swear that for all its rounded beauty s8 is more fragile than prior phones with metal plastic edging just so you know
4,upgraded from galaxy s5 this phone is huge improvement love galaxy but this phone does everything need more
5,absolutely love love love my s8 waited for years for it to come out before upgraded from my s6 love orchid grey color but wish it had little more purple to it
5,for almost past two years have been using lg v10 also purchased from bb it great phone but just too big my wife had been using my old galaxy s4 which caused me to miss samsung clean functional intuitive design am so happy with this phone it works as it should everything is where you think it should be size is just right big gorgeous screen without being mammoth phablet it has some incredible features as well some unique to samsung wish back was more grippy as it has slid out of my pocket unknown to me case that came free with phone will hopefully take care of that it also is annoying at times in landscape view you have to be careful not to activate something on screen by touching top bottom edges both these problems can be easily overcome however also considered lg g6 when choosing new phone haven had galaxy since my s4 am very happy to be back
5,so far so good it was as good as advertised battery doesn show any issues with overheating during charge over usage
4,my old samsung nexus finally died on me after five years of service so it was time for new one researched best phones online samsung galaxy s8 was clear winner according to every major review read it probably does way more that really need but wanted to have best phone available since use my phone for work may need some of technical features later down line only reason that am not giving phone five star rating is because of high price tag it is more than most laptop computers it is high tech but still feel it is bit pricey for phone no matter how you spin it
5,this is samsungs best phone untill release of note
4,s8 is my first smart phone it has been very easy to use photos are quite clear precise my son like mine so much he decided to get other model available s8
5,samsung galaxy s8 is excellent telephone for replaceing my tired galaxy s3
5,large screen great display wonderful camera pictures fast my previous phone was iphone much happier with navigation personalization on my s8
5,this new s8 is my wife incredibly fast sleek powerful tons of new features clarity of images video is awesome love finger print relocated to back by camera lots of security features eye face finger print biometric scanning tools too many features to list love curved edge to edge screen so clear gb upgraded from 32gb easy to hold sleek thin profile you ll love this phone
5,was ready for upgrade new s8 is excellent option
5,omg where to begin love it had s5 edge that was ok but s8 has so many more features love everything about it
5,samsung galaxy s8 is durable phone that is greatly improved from s7 battery life also improved much better camera
5,phone was fine but offered very little memory for money made switch to android feature packed with tons of memory plus expandable
5,do not have single complaint about s8 if had critique it would be less bloatware but other than that it is fantastic phone screen is amazing still cannot get over how black blacks are on screen it just blends into phone battery life is great
5,storm was very helpful when it came to pick up my phone
5,was looking to replace phone from different manufacturer as was getting ready to pull trigger on s7 jokingly asked when s8 was due out after bit of hemming hawing was told that it was scheduled for spring of think salesperson was worried about missing sale no date had been set for release but glad waited this device works great with both cars chromecast as well as smart tv vr has also been fun thus far edge side menu is great feature for favorite apps weather most used contacts several other options that have chosen to skip for now my favorite feature is fingerprint security hated having to mess with passwords pins just to access my own phone especially at home like that nobody else can gain access at same time don feel like have to ask for permission to check email texts also use my device as second backup for all of my music photos personal files extra storage is wonderful haven even mentioned that screen is beyond fantastic basic screens have smooth look to them oh might add that if you ever need it it phone too
5,previous phone was s6 edge much larger screen with only slightly larger phone is very useful battery is frequently good for two days while s6 was never better than one solid day use return of expandable memory water resistance are very valuable upgrades
4,voice to text is horrible predictive text literally makes up words but rest is pretty impressive so far
5,jumped from samsung galaxy s4 to this s8 still learning some of features of phone still customizing things like home screen getting used edge feature which really reduces clutter on home screen absolutely love camera it works great in low light recently took picture of table setting with candle candle light didn confuse autofocus which happens on most cameras even on my nikon d80 can do close up shots with background out of focus as if it is wide aperture slr
5,am very pleased with my galaxy s8 phone had galaxy s4 was hesitant to upgrade very happy did it resolution ease of use without all extra apps never have used is very welcoming it holds charge sleek design with infinity screen is perfect
5,its great phone hard to get used to curved edges
5,ve used samsung phones for quite while now this new galaxy s8 is by far smoothest fastest phone ever it works great does anything everything need it to do fast efficiently can recommend this phone enough
5,not wanting to renew my contract each time new phone comes out used galaxy s5 for previous years this is helluva upgrade over s5 only drawback is curved screen is hard to click on at edges great picture sound
4,new s8 seems to be dropping calls ve had verizon for years although this could be carrier problem it seems strange that this is happening now otherwise performing well
5,have had many samsung galaxy phones still like them s8 has usual great features of samsung galaxy did switch from s8 plus to s8 because didn like larger size so much for trying to get it out of my pocket still learning new features
5,love it nuff said
5,this phone is great was coming from google pixel which also like but this phone just fits so amazing in your hand has way better features only down side is finger print scanner placement but you honestly get used to it it nothing
5,love that phone was able to be picked up from best buy
4,upgrade my phone every two years this one was little harder to get used to curved edge is little troublesome finally installed gboard keyboard because was having trouble typing kept accidentally swiping in edge screen
5,this phone is solid product its battery life is vastly improved over earlier s3 water dust exclusion rating gives sense of security it charges very quickly inclusion of microsd slot increases its flexibility two downsides are that battery is not user replaceable that both samsung verizon load so much bloatware onto phone
5,galaxy lover purchased this phone weekend it was released love it so far only this that doesn make sense to me yet is bixby why would they release phone when bixby isn fully developed for another months at this point bixby is useless to me but otherwise love phone
4,jury is still out but so far like it bought it fast when previous phone died fits nicely in hand for one hand operation good camera still lots of features to learn about
5,have had cell phones in past years by far this is best one user friendly with star rating
5,screen quality side are perfect great resolution easy to use
5,traded my samsung galaxy s5 up to s8 love camera also love that didn lose water resistant feature of s5 am enjoying my new phone
5,switched from motorola to s8 been reading consumer reports reviews for over years touting samsung as working just as advertised in my first two weeks
5,have had issues with this phone yet not even any scratches on screen it charges mega fast keeps charge long time very impressed also camera is hella tight
5,great phone used to have iphone after trying out this phone im never going back
5,upgraded from s4 mini width is similar which fits my hand length is okay like smaller phones love camera finding my way not as hard as thought it might be moving from mini in easy mode would have like to get quick guide in box rather than having to download manual
4,using phone little over days now haven had any issues battery life is good calls sound great can find anything wrong with it other than that there stuff on there pulse retina scanner fingerprint scanner that ll never use they could probably fit in larger battery something useful if they got rid of that useless stuff
5,upgraded from s5 love versatility excellent camera
5,upgraded from s4 am so impressed with speed of course battery lasting more than day getting used to new apps love them have gig plan for same price as old gig plan so can use phone now than before plus it so much easier more responsive
5,very happy with s8 faster longer battery life better finger print recognition better screen
5,very happy with s8 faster longer battery life better finger print recognition better screen
5,samsung has created very unique for now anyways phone rest assured if purchasing this phone that you ll have best that out right now you won regret it makes every other phone looks really old square can picture myself having non curve phone bezel less phones are next big push s8 just set bar followers will soon jump
5,my wife loves her new phone we would purchase again

5,huge improvement for me going from s6 to s8 love it in every way
5,still hate bixby button but overall love improvement going from s6 to s8
5,great camera great screen good battery life getting hours screen on time haven tried any powersaving modes yet performance is great have seen no lag like samsungs of old really enjoy size feel in hand my favorite thing about it is that screen looks exactly same outside as it does inside no more straining to see my screen in direct sunlight only thing wish was different about this phone is that bixby button should be remappable because other than camera search feature bixby is completely useless clone of google now wont count bixby as negative though because its extra doesn take anything away from otherwise great phone lastly fingerprint location is blown way out of proportion by tech reviewers use mine daily with either hand no problem
5,love phone which has great camera looks great works like phone should
4,very nice phone better than iphone which returned for this phone
4,being ok computer person found camera easy use
4,love phone very disappointed that there aren readily available protective glass covers that get great reviews within weeks of getting my phone researching screen protectors decided to wait my worse fear was realized phone with cover on back dropped from distance of feet screen is toast samsung-stop rushing to get product out door before accessories are available

3,love phone with one exception bluetooth performance is pretty poor range is terrible when riding in my car can get bluetooth signal to cut out simply by covering phone with my hand also sometimes ability to control audio on phone via bluetooth controls buttons on bluetooth headset my car steering wheel will stop working entirely until restart phone
5,this phone is awesome compared to any iphone buy it
5,still learning all new features no problems at this point other than curved screen doesn take glass protector shield very well

5,haven had this phone long but so far so good love full screen picture is so clear sound is great too
5,real nice phone takes great pictures really like full sreen
4,came from iphone things are much better than years ago when had android moving from iphone to this had learning curve but it overall great
4,battery lasts all day only complaint is that charging cord end was changed from previous samsung phones so now have to purchase converters for my car extra portable chargers unless want to buy all new cords it came with only one converter did find some online for cheap so at least don have to buy them from verizon
5,love this phone great clarity speed love camera quality this was main reason for purchasing this one
4,still trying to learn many features it has setting up bluethtooth speakers was little confusing but really like dual audio able to play music through speakers at same time
5,was apple user for life my boyfriend convinced me to switch it took some getting used to but love it
5,coming from s7 edge size performance of s8 is amazing phone is little smaller sleeker at first was little nervous about down sizing in battery size but so far this phone easily lasts all day have never felt that may run out of battery life performance wise it exceeds my needs all around it is best phone have ever owned would recommend it to any android user
4,like phone with everything compared with other phones one thing is that battery length should be like s7 that was down grade to s8 process for promotional products should of been easier especially when you buy more than one product
4,my first samsung phone very easy to navigate fast processing excellent pictures slightly disappointed in he bixby debacle not ready for full use out of box bixby button placement was not well thought out but still pretty awesome phone absolutely no issue with location of fingerprint scanner
5,switched from iphone plus don regret it at all
5,everything about this phone is awesome top of line specs screen is so crisp clear colorful comes with 64gb of memory at start no need to worry about memory issues phone is so fast you can as many apps open as you want my wife upgraded to this phone from here original turbo she loves it am so jealous always want to see her phone now with gear vr it even better if upgrade soon will get this phone
5,this is good update to galaxy s7 more screen fact that it is narrower is nice for those of us with smaller hands fingerprint scanner moved to back does not seem intuitive at first but if you couple it with option to immediately unlock phone go to home screen it works pretty good you get used to change quickly
5,have not had any issues with samsung phone still learning some features this is my 3rd samsung phone very happy with their products
5,it was time to upgrade good time to do so battery life is great
5,love this phone it is clear great battery fast connection speed quick transfer connection allowed me to suck out all my contacts out of my piece of crud iphone
5,there is so much going on with s8 that still don know all features it has call clarity is amazing bluetooth connection is strong infinity screen is best samsung has outdone themselves even with system upgrade ve had no problem with data speed of cpu
5,my favorite phone so far they definitely got it right this time
4,whats not to love screen camera battery water resistance sd card hdr tiny bezels wireless charging agk headphones great sound great accessories
4,have had no problems with phone so far hasn snow down froze up durning app switching as far as battery life goes it get through my day only time have to worry about it dying is if playing lot of games that day with brightness turned up only thing would change is placement of fingerprint sensor it can be hard to reach but after while got used to it
5,started looking to upgrade my phone earlier this year checked out some of moto lg options at time all so huge bulky decided to wait for galaxy s8 so glad did phone is incredibly sleek comfortable similar feel but overall huge upgrade from my old moto x2 camera is spectacular has newest processor android version so runs like dream definitely beats lg g6 still have difficulty finding fingerprint sensor placing my finger just right not best design placement next to camera would have preferred below centered but honestly retina recognition for unlocking works incredibly well even in varying light conditions through glasses contacts etc still waiting hoping for additional bixby features but overall excellent phone with very few downsides
5,best phone ve ever owned crystal clear voice on phone calls great photos perfect size wish battery lasted little longer but no biggie
5,any issues have been resolved with recent updates battery has been excellent but not heavy user screen is best in business only con would say is location of finger print reader
3,like it but plan not cheep bit heavy compared to what use to
3,camera is big wonderful improvement also speed do not like that it is harder to text on this phone am currently experiencing issues with my voice not always being heard when am talking

5,truly think this is best phone have ever owned edges are so useful not in way as everyone reported with s7 edge definitely satisfied with this purchase
5,am glad got this phone it fast camera clear sound is excellent got it from preorder got vr it fun to watch from vr
4,at first only reason got samsung galaxy was because samsung makes great phone my contract was expiring at same time when got phone not super impressed then noticed button underneath volume controls so pushed it hello bixby showed up on screen needless to say after playing around with it that program is awesome at knowing my preferences also bixby vision function on camera is something that know everyone who has smart phone can enjoy being able to pull text off of pic then to search for that text translate foreign language to shop for that item you just took pic of to be able to find where you are from taking picture of landmarks is mind blowing
5,phone is awesome very slim compare to others brand such as iphone lg google etc display is greatest seem do far phone also fits in ons hand like that it is wayer resistance that it had micro sd card up to 256gb for storing all your music pictures movies etc
5,phone is awesome very slim compare to others brand such as iphone lg google etc display is greatest seem do far phone also fits in ons hand thing don like is fingerprint reader on back sometimes have problem opening phone with my fingerprint other than that is best phone by far

4,s8 screen helped me to forget my iphone 64gb space expandable memory finally helps me to load netflix movies shows without dreaded out of space messages on my apple
5,never get next new phone when it comes out usually because of price any tweaks that may be needed after new release would just buy version prior to new release so was always one upgarde behind not this time samsung s8 was too nice for same monthly fee got it plus neat gear vr best decision ever made so glad went to best buy for this upgrade better deals than vzw

3,pre-ordered purchased s8 about weeks ago phone has great screen runs clean at least it did recently it has been randomly rebooting googled galaxy s8 random reboot problem this seems to be pretty common problem among s8 owners samsung has not admitted yet that there is problem with this but if you look at their support site it is full of complaints of this happening most have not found anything that corrects problem in fact many people reported getting phone replaced have same problem with new phone think this is last time will get in on front end of new product

5,case sparkles protects my wife loves it more than any other case she has had in past
4,it fit phone perfect was easy to install great product
5,this is my second samsung device after galaxy s2 have been using this phone for little while than weeks here are my findings pros first thing that catches your attention is infinity screen body ratio that can be easily caught in single hand without any hassle good battery backup that last whole day on medium usage quick charge that charges your phone from to full charge in minutes water resistant which tried in pool for minutes there are many more but these are three most important ones cons phone gets too much heated on heavy usage like gaming too much samsung verizon carrier related bloatware which we may not use uses up space long run may reduce efficiency of phone these are all could say about phone now will keep you updated on my further usage
5,slim light display picture quality is awesome perfect size great price it not apple product
4,my daughter got new galaxy s8 says it is much better than s5 faster holds more apps
5,really like this phone it fast intuitive not super into curved screens though but guess that just how it goes now sometimes it makes it easier to accidently open up apps that are on perimeter originally didn like always on display but now find it much easier to wake phone up if have that all in all glad purchased this phone
5,s8 has everything ve come to love about samsung plus many more features
3,not loving phone yet huge learning curve not sure if will keep it go back to my iphone
5,just got done taking this phone on alaskan cruise camera performed way beyond expectations
4,phone was suggested to me by best buy employees like it very much but there are some aspects that are different from my last phone however chose samsung because there people at best buy who are able to answer questions give tutorials on samsung products
5,am very happy with my new galaxy s8 it looks amazing has all features you would want in latest smartphone
2,think there are to many updates all time phone is actually smaller than my old one don like that have to come in take class to learn something

3,this is my first samsung phone first time away from iphone since ve had this phone since shortly after it came out so its been couple of months gave it stars because bet if you re used to android it awesome upgrade there is just too many things that are difficult making switch from iphone to samsung use google for many things on my iphone phone is cool for most part it works ok it cool having widgets that are functional but certain apps don function well like transit but that app problem cons that warrant stars from me keep having trouble with voice assist turning on with some magical button press it serious pain to turn it off nothing gets done while it on why would vision assistant need to turn on off with quick buttons anyway either you can see you can phone also seems to reset previous settings ve already had volume sync needs to be redone with devices ve already connected to like my car headphones but it not predictable to me yet sometimes it keeps sometimes it doesn palm swipe for screen capture turns off regularly as well bixby was just activated it not very helpful stick with google assistant place where home button would be doesn always work for me to turn screen on that unnerving had difficulty with contacts syncing over google all of my contacts with iphones could not be used it seemed to be tied to area code being in parenthesis maybe this is android problem would not recommend switching to this phone if you were looking to get away from iphone after some time it challenging
3,like usual samsung overhyped this phone to be best thing since sliced bread so figure tried it against my better judgment because every time ve tried samsung device ve been disappointed after using it for few days it constantly got slower slower because of hundreds of bloatware garbage apps running in background that samsung loads phone up with that you can remove making it sluggish not near as good as my iphone which just returned it for went back to
2,this phone has some cool features but it is so slow to load anything am only giving it stars also widgets constently move to different locations lot of time app has two icons on same screen can get past how slow it is so annoying
4,have few questions but am headed to best buy today to get little assistance from one of very professional specialist
4,really like phone so far would recommend this phone
4,this phone is easy to use it has clear screen view takes outstanding pictures
4,love it no complaints yet love size screen quality
4,found that they made extra edge on phone has no use did not use edge like quality of sound did not try camera yet am still in process of learning how to use this phone so far like this phone
5,samsung g8 is best phone that steals away heart
5,this phone is fast have good stuff on it if you samsung fan you ll like
5,absolutely love this phone screen looks amazing added features like bixby are great battery life so far is amazing love iris scan to unlock phone runs faster smoother
1,phone gets stuck soo much not sure if got defected phone what but no one can hear me on my speaker bluetooth
4,have had samsung for while s7 had software battery issues software issues went away now my phone just has battery issues
5,everything is working great so far it is super fast smooth it beautiful it charges really fast camera is excellent has lot of different filters to choose from sound quality is great also like how samsung is so customizable aside from that thankful that didn buy screen protector hope they fix that soon
1,liked my samsung much better easier to learn how to work phone was easier to move apps around remove like certain games apps samsung even after going back to best buy meeting with samsung rep he too had to ask for help
1,not even two weeks old screen turned green it won charge had to shut down before it dies completely no one can see what wrong going without phone all weekend until can get to best buy on monday loved it until this happened
1,nice phone but not as good as iphone takes great photos very light weight
1,bought s8 it beautiful phone but dropped it less than 3ft in new otter box back glass broke because whole phone is glass best buy only has day return period on cell phones this happened on 17th day not happy customer
1,hated phone best buy locked our verizon account it took calls visits to get this mess cleaned up went back to verizon to upgrade
2,love phone but don drop it we were waiting for case to come in mail my wife dropped it from table on corner broke screen under screen protector not impressed with durability at all
5,debated for long time never ended up preordering it wish would have because free vr woulda been awesome swapped from years of iphone use so there has been learning curve with android however pho os have been awesome phone feels solid great screen fast fast fast processing speed only downfall see so far is battery life which is on par with my old iphone not better iris scanner has few short comings but overall works better than anticipated highly recommend this phone look forward to apples response to it
1,makes screen useless took it off after days don waste your money
1,just spent bunch of money on s8 that was supposed to be greatest phone ever shatter proof water proof all of that but turns out phone will shatter in your pocket now im stuck with expensive broken phone that im sure isnt water proof anymore because shatter proof screen broke second day had it
1,just got my new galaxy s8 it won always let me answer calls what good is phone if you can answer calls on it love everything else about phone but need to answer calls
1,saw my younger son accidentally walk into my older son owner of phone saw phone take simple little ft drop at most onto sidewalk screen cracked in corners glass broke off big crack going diagonally across screen drop my iphone half dozen times every single day in yrs have not broken screen it taken some bag drops falls kicked around my son wanted this phone for one of reasons being its durability ya right
4,this phone to me has few cons my hands are small so can not reach finger print scanner with one hand so can use it iris scanner is kind of weird to use because you have to hold your phone up in front of your face people look at you weird when you go it face scanner has been most successful screen is amazing you have to go in to setting enable to use whole screen in each app it does not automatically use whole screen bixby doesn work to well but told it will more use it phone it self if longer slimmer than my previous s6 edge little disappointed that face iris scanner will not work in low lights so at night have to unlock it with code
5,this is best phone have ever had it great looks awesome don hesitate buy this phone you won regret it
1,returned husband disliked very much would not recommend
1,bought samsung s8 from my local best buy store after few days realized s8 will be better for me went to return verizon has days return policy was day over they refused said see if best buy could take store return sales guy who was helping sent email to store manager it was sunday never heard back am physician had limited time only on weekend to go do this return policy should be days these are complex devices it not possible to learn all within weeks make decision if you are busy
1,am very unhappy with this phone nothing but problems
1,pre ordered this phone due to best buy samsung employee telling me about dollar full immersive package so went to best buy multiple times to play with s8 which is mins away mind you than eventually returned lg g6 which was actually great phone hrs sot fantastic screen camera my thinking was that finally samsung best buy got it together to make things right over note s7e issues actually had issues with multiple s7e well it turned out that package was already sold out before best buy even had phones was so excited until paid for phone than after phone was mine best buy employee said that package was out so was duped from get go from best buy samsung thinking that was going to get this deal shame on them to drive pre orders up trick consumers so onto phone phone is literally same as s7e in skinnier more awkward frame smaller battery camera is actually same piece of hardware finger print scanner is still slow compared to other manufacturers in weird spot already got finger prints all over camera as matter of fact besides looks all samsung programs wont actually use since they waste battery life lg g6 is much better buy overall phone how ever audio output is def better then s7e out of jack hear bluetooth is better too
