battery,so far so good with iphone battery lasts long time compared to old iphone
battery,hope battery lasts longer than 6s has recently like updated camera features
battery,like updated camera features hope battery hold charge longer than old phone
battery,switched to apple from samsung for convenience my car is apple friendly it sounded like good reason at time happy with phone battery life apps so forth just prefer samsung over apple if you re apple lover you ll love this phone
battery,great phone glad to be away from large plus size battery life seemed better on plus but still get over day on this one so nothing to be concerned about
battery,battery life appears to be excellent phone is lightning fast takes excellent pictures haven found anything do not like about it rated stars based on reviews read that glass back can easily be broken not even going to take chance so it went from shelf into otterbox
battery,battery life is not any better than iphone6 had
battery,had while this isn huge step forward it def marked improvement over my love stereo speakers improved battery just overall performance didn want to spend money on very happy with this
battery,until you have extra power you don know what you re missing in today phone usage we spend time on social media news sports sites so clarity of sound picture are great battery life will knock your socks off best phone yet

battery,very satisfied with speed battery life highly recommend
battery,purchased phone couple weeks ago it has worked great very easy to figure out has awesome camera battery life is good as well
battery,this iphone is little faster than 6s had also battery lasts longer otherwise it is pretty much same
battery,battery life on this phone is great can go day without charging phone that with heavy use
battery,love my new iphone no cracks like my old battery lasts all day
battery,easy to use program goodbattery life superb camera screen resolution
battery,phone is great battery life is best ve seen from iphone yet also glass seems to be stronger time will tell love they want back to there original black shade
battery,would not bother with upgrading if you have iphone 6s better my battery on my 6s was not lasting as long as would like so decided to upgrade don feel like anything earth shattering came of it in hindsight it would probably have been better to just replace battery on my 6s having said that there is nothing wrong with this phone but it was expensive purchase for not that much more utility it does fee nicer to hold though
battery,i-phone is up to task little pricey but attractive solid device with very good battery response like then size screen resolution is great design change for headphones was unnecessary but at least they give you adapter
battery,phone very seldom used battery won hold charge
battery,great phone too many options to mention great battery life camera is crazy good
battery,if you have iphone earlier this is worthy upgrade battery life is noticeably faster than my iphone there bit of learning curve getting used to new home button but it worth upgrade if you re eligible for it
battery,my biggest complaint about was battery life no more complaining is awesome charges quick doesnt drain immediately
battery,have had iphones love way they just work know many of android phones compete maybe even have more features have thought about switching at times thing that keeps me coming back is incremental improvements to great phone that works breadth of app store is incomparable iphone isn much different from previous generation but it does seem to be lot faster it has good battery life miss headphone jack but am finding ways to work around change
battery,was so disappointed in battery life ve shut off all that not necessary don use yet battery doesn last long need to keep it in low battery mode put it in airplane mode when not using it my old iphone had better battery only thing better than my old phone is camera but it not like taking professional pictures that needed better camera by this time apple should have fantastic product phone has only been out one week already they have update very disappointed in this phone that is that expensive
battery,phone feels behaves lot like battery size etc but glass back gives it nice look pretty solid phone all in all if you want to retain touch id sensor
battery,owned apple had trouble with it am ever so sorry bought battery doesn hold charge contacts touch letter it brings up who ever very poor
battery,probably not worth it if you re upgrading from iphone but if you re doing verizon payment plan why not right upgrades are faster processor wireless charging this method charges very slowly only beneficial overnight think faster cable charging can usually get battery life in about hour slightly better camera that really it upgraded from that iphone se that seemed very fast it ran same processor as 6s mean honestly at certain point faster processors won matter glass back is very pretty but outer rim is still aluminum so it is very prone to dents everyone is waiting for iphone anyway haha
battery,traded my son iphone for iphone battery last much longer everything runs smoother faster another happy purchase from best buy
battery,haven had iphone since my 4s decided to switch to samsung now back to iphone love it battery life is fantastic use it listening to music about hrs at work after hr shift have battery life still charge phone every other day it kool not having to worry if phone will run out of battery

screen,new iphones are underwhelming its nice that hardware software are little better than previous models but phones are overpriced glass on phone front back cause it to slide off of surfaces frequently make it difficult to hold in my hand prefer metal-backed phones because friction makes them easier to hold have dropped this phone many times have already cracked screen very glad didn pay for
screen,my mother got this for herself she wasn to fond of bigger screen so she got smaller version of she has been use to home button being physical button so this one has home button from iphone which has that taptic feedback home button which isn actual button just felt really weird for her but eventually got how it works now it not issue other than that she says it nice upgrade for iphone if you need to upgrade want smaller screen
screen,this is great option over iphone on paper it will be just as fast with smaller lower resolution screen lower price point it feels great to hold familiar which don mind would not upgrade if you have but if you are coming from it is worth it

battery,phone it self is really nice has some really nice features loved iris scanner battery seemed to last nice amount for me but within first day of having it it would randomly restart it would happen about 6-10 times day got it swapped out with new phone it did same thing after taking it to samsung in local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it he did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it but no solution yet this seems to be common problem even though it not being widely reported on do search for galaxy s8 restarting it going on weeks since release no comment from samsung see samsung community boards people are calling samsung they are still telling them ve never heard of this ended up returning mine before days
battery,this phone is absolutely amazing looks good processes fast uses less battery life than it predecessor
battery,overall phone is ok however it seems to activate apps on it own when it is in my pocket it pocket dials lot even though have locked it before putting it in my pocket touchscreen on bottom instead of home button is bit of hassle know phone has many new features but battery life is disappointing if you have any real significant use
battery,phone is very good price was very good got it on sale at off plus got in trade for my old galaxy s5 very pleased with phone so far great design faster than my old phone plenty of storage battery is good there were couple of glitches some of my apps didn transfer from my old phone so had to download them again old phone voice mail didn get transferred to new phone had to spend quite bit of time with at to fix that also it still too time consuming too much paperwork to get new phone upgrade spent over two hours at best buy there should be way to streamline all that but it good product nice looking phone it got case screen protector those are little pricey for what they are but necessary would give phone four half stars if possible
battery,realize have hard time changing phones however this one is not user friendly had to turn off touch setting as phone is really sensitive swiping through screens frustrating battery drains very quickly definately not happy with this purchase have bit of time for first time in phone purchases am seriously thinking of returning it
battery,so far am enjoying this phone very much it is quick easy to use have already learned how to customize it to my liking this might seem easy to you but for year old that is not smartphone savvy think doing good have not used camera much yet but pictures have taken look very good still have to try upload something to fb one of these days transferring everything from old phone to this one was quite easy also was fortunate enough to have people at bestbuy do it for me when bought it but all they did was hook up cables it pretty much did work for them would say use my phone less than most younger people so my battery seems to last good while would usually be at battery with my galaxy but with this galaxy s8 lowest have seen my battery go down to is so to me that is big difference have not had any issues with calling with this phone although my wife also has same phone sometimes people have trouble hearing her but we are not sure if it is her phone theirs overall am very pleased with this phone but let see how it does in next months so
battery,love it great phone good battery life not to big
battery,wonderful phone great colors battery pretty good highly suggest
battery,this phone is beautiful slim you will love it when you saw it at first glimpse but os is kind disappointing if you install more apps you get higher chance of slow stack all kinds of problems battery drain out very quickly after using for few months now miss iphone
battery,phone is fast responsive great camera pics good battery life
battery,decided to upgrade to s8 after battery on my s6 drained so much so often battery life on s8 only requires me to charge my phone once per day hi love it it definitely worth upgrading for that reason alone

battery,screen is gorgeous battery is amazing this is dad one of best galaxy phones have ever owned

battery,great phone camera takes outstanding pictures battery lasts longer than most other phones
battery,purchased this phone for my dad great phone nice battery life awesome camera he loves it
battery,battery life on samsung s8 smartphone is great improvement over previous models as is camera find bixby feature bit annoying could probably do without it it certainly doesn have nearly capability of alexis sir overall s8 is good but probably overpriced product
battery,this is my 3rd galaxy series device as always this one has not disappointed at all excellent screen beauty to behold awesome camera quality in both outdoor low-light conditions battery life to last days with medium usage just wish that blue color had been around when bought this
battery,really nice phone good camera long battery life
battery,replaced older smartphone big jump in features find that battery life little better than old phone with caveat you need to put battery on mid power to last day going to assume there is just too many programs running in background sucking juice other than that it great phone screen is super clear
battery,constantly freezes so that you have to reset only to find your battery has drained by more than half
battery,display is excellent takes great pictures battery lasts long time
battery,this phone has great battery life is waterproof recently upgraded from samsung s6 edge easily could tell difference in battery life recommend this phone buying case soon as you purchase
battery,when my galaxy s5 started acting very sluggish started looking around online for reviews of newer model phones samsung galaxy line remained top in line in regards to what my needs wants were was back forth between s6 s7 s8 was not necessarily looking for newest model but after talking with sales rep in best buy store it was better deal to go with new s8 must say am extremely happy with my s8 buying experience am still finding new things that phone does every day features are pretty awesome display is amazing great battery life great phone
battery,like phone so far color is gorgeous still trying out new features great battery life so far
battery,nice slim phone excellent battery life takes great pictures sound is very clear
battery,screen audio speed battery etc all great upgraded from iphone first time android user so far loving it highly recommend
battery,love this phone battery lasts me all day use it constantly display is beautiful bixby is work in progress but has ton of potential upgraded from note am glad did
battery,functionality screen size are goodbut battery life still is something to be desired
battery,had phone exactly weeks when it asked for update after update phone was dead before update my phone had over charge was working perfectly then after update it would not turn on show light when plugged in for charging spent minutes on phone with tech who had me hold down every combo of buttons possible nothing have never dropped my phone it was only weeks old essentially brand new according to many online posts this has been constant problem with new phone especially since you can no longer remove battery for hard reboot this is so disappointing have always raved about samsung products now my faith is shaken
battery,have spent lot of time finding out all featured of this phone love everything about it although not huge fan of curved screens find that they aren issue with this phone screen isn curved as much as previous edge phone it makes viewing photos videos very nice on this phone camera takes beautiful pictures videos sound on this device is also very good battery life is also really good only con of phone is trying to find glass screen protector for it that works so far have only found that zagg glass one works is case friendly
battery,very responsive phone battery life is okay prefer fingerprint scanner to facial recognition other features are nice
battery,like this phone so far but also liked my s6 active before battery stopped working
battery,s8 is best phone out from camera to thw battery life you will not be dissapointed
battery,ve always been skeptical of flagship galaxy phones from samsung every year they ve always been made out of plastic samsung custom apps ui they forced on user were horrendous however galaxy s8 is first time ve truly considered purchased galaxy phone because of improvements to build quality material less bloatware pre-loaded on phone it really great phone with great battery life phenomenal camera
battery,great screen battery life overall easy phone to use
battery,great phone big screen good battery life waterproof nice glass aluminum feel it has headphone jack

battery,phone has very sleek look to it it is perfect size even though it isn plus battery life is very efficient as well
battery,if you will excuse cliche this samsung latest greatest there is too much to say about this in short review but here are some highlights pros great camera with pro mode for photographers like me other great modes like hyperlapse haven tried it yet very fast phone apps launch quickly lots of storage space at 64gb gorgeous screen am not sure curved part is advantage but this amoled makes things look amazing great battery life fast charging works great with included charger came with great deal on gear if purchased about same time have wanted camera for while cons curved screen can make it challenge to touch edges of screen makes it possibly more vulnerable to drops longer shape makes it easier for it to fall out of your shirt pocket is non-standard not sure why they chose this ratio no removable battery for when you are away from charger for long periods of time upgraded from galaxy s4 overall am very happy with s8 highly recommend it
battery,after using this for couple weeks device feels great in hand display is great overall interface is snappy battery life is good enough but not great
battery,phone works well am have great time using it thought it would be hard to find screen protector that fits phone because had same problem on my s7 edge but it was so easy to find one however compared to iphones battery life is still like lacking in samsung part overall it is still great phone

battery,cons whites are not as good as my honor it more of warm white yes ve adjusted it in color settings phone is little over contrasted in color it good for scenery photography but sometimes my skin color looks more reddish wish samsung would add contrast adjust in settings pros everything else about phone is amazing looks makes it competitors look out of date battery is fairly good samsungs gui is so good dont need 3rd party launcher it is quick size is spot on
battery,saw my new galaxy phone had to have one just like it she appreciates call quality battery life
battery,switched from galaxy s8 haven looked back great screen resolution snappy performance amazing battery life bixby voice would be nice but google assistant does decent job in meantime

battery,it fast responsive device it looks feels sleek is quite thin light wish battery was replaceable it also bit slippery wish back was somewhat textured know that it uses usb-c connector so ended up also getting few new cables to replace my sub mini cables
battery,hated to get new phone but samsung made it easy with included sync cable that allows you to transfer everything that you want from old phone to new one love feel of s8 still learning all features but camera is excellent battery life is great so far
battery,ve had galaxy phone since original so fairly familiar with them this is by far best one ve ever had much faster better build than my previous s5 battery life is massive improvement

battery,went from s5 to s8 it was like going from flip phone to smart one am still learning about all features absolutely love fact that battery will last whole day needing recharge even when it being used love new cameras too
battery,purchased samsung galaxy s8 having previously owned galaxy s6 edge so have used some of features samsung has provided past couple years difference on this phone is am using more of those features than did before fingerprint option is better now with reader being on back my hand is usually holding it right there anyway so that helps me to keep from entering code every time although have tried facial recognition prefer not to use it it just doesn seem as secure reliable as pin fingerprint couple of other nice features is ability to sync my google accounts with mail photos drive etc have not yet used bixby feature but it seems like it is capable of learning your habits providing you with customized content that would be beneficial plan to give that try samsung pay is so easy on this phone am using it now as well one last option will mention is when updated to this phone brought over my most used apps they seem to run better on this phone battery life is way better than s6 leave location on most of time now my battery keeps its charge much better jordan at best best mobile in norman oklahoma sooner mall was very knowledgeable about products as well as options available he gave me all available promotions including fast charge wireless charger gift card appreciate his help in deciding what accessories to purchase for this phone iphone my wife decided to buy also jordan helped us get set up in our new phones by transferring from our old phones right in store
battery,just purchased new galaxy s8 family member has s7 they are both excellent devices long battery life expandable memory great screen best buy often offers promos on these devices

battery,phones seem to always kick bucket before your ready for it however so far this phone has been great battery life is amazing new screen is pretty cool
battery,upgraded from galaxy s5 to s8 owned s5 for over years it had only general wear tear but no major scratches cracks even without ever using case taking some major spills s8 back is made of glass first crack scratch showed up within week not sure how it even got there at week mark phone fell out of my waist pocket back broke cracked significantly am still waiting on my case to show up from samsung promotions otherwise would have covered it up already second major gripe is that fitbit is incompatible with this phone due to bluetooth have blaze that is less than year old was having all kinds of crazy bt problems with phone car audio streaming would skip like cd player blaze battery would drain at to3x original original speed blaze unable to connect to phone for notification gps bt headset would keep cutting out after removing fitbit app from my phone all those problems went away worked issue with both samsung fitbit support but it turned into finger pointing battle guess samsung strategy paid off because had to go out buy gear fit just to have something that would work
battery,amazing phone battery life is great customization is limitless edge screen is also very cool love this phone

camera,this cell is wonderful pictures fitness app is great
camera,this phone is great upgrade from my s6 camera is great
camera,am really enjoying this awsome phone love camera everything else about this phone its amazing
camera,pictures are wonderful but don but glass hd screen protector it makes it very hard to push buttons
screen,am very happy with new s8 it has been very easy to use hold would not go without case at all get screen protector protection plan asap
screen,awesome phone what else is there to say absolutely beautiful design stunning display packed with plenty of storage for most enough power to do anything you reasonably want phone to do
screen,it great phone just wish they wld do away with curved edge of phone because it seems pointless also makes it difficult to use good screen protectors phone cases
screen,phone is useful but it is not as agile as my s5 it is irritating that something that is made well is removed from market when upgrading occurs why not just update internals maintain already functional format curved screen is no big deal phone just another fad selling point my expectations are for amount of money spent want something strong functional don bother me me with foolish fads
screen,ve had this phone for few months now have found it very easy to use ve previously used lg also iphone like display on this better than both of those my one complaint though is how easily screen gets scratched recommend getting screen protector immediately let my husband talk me into waiting couple days in order to buy screen protector that was on sale online ended up with scratch on screen within couple hours of owning phone even though was very very careful still somehow got scratch that annoys me every time look at my phone
screen,great phone beautiful screen very useful slim agile
screen,always love my samsung products this is no exception went from s7 appreciate all updates only thing don like is not being able to find tempered glass screen protector that fits well ve finally given up on it
screen,it nice phone with good features wish they wld do away with curved edge it seems pointless also makes it difficult to use good screen protectors phone cases
screen,touch screen is sometimes hard to use do love canada speaker goes out though
screen,replaced my galaxy for this galaxy 8s some features are nice it was easy to learn new navigation system curved edge means have to use plastic screen guard instead of glass one plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils charging cable is shorter than on my galaxy s5 have dropped it times this week because of picking it up from charger cord is too short never dropped my galaxy s5 needs charging daily
screen,first smart phones for family easy to use large screen protective case highly recommended
screen,screen is amazing it is crazy fast does everything need
screen,nice phone still trying to adjust to this type of screen as it is very different than previous phones
screen,infinity screen is gorgeous for media consumption you can find no better current mobile option imo it is fast at all tasks slim design makes it much easier to handle in your hand
screen,there are lot of great aspect to this phone but it not as adaptable as other phones there certain things that you can change controlle that is more of annoyance with this phone for instance text dictionary normally when you try say one thing phone will auto correct it to what it thinks you were trying to say then when you change that specific word sentence there is way to add to dictionary but not on this phone this next sentence will be unaltered so you can see what taking about in whay way dies auto correct dies this its supposed to say in what way does auto correct does this so now your left repeating same mistakes over over again its annoying there should be way do add words to your dictionary so you don have to keep editing what you re trying to say there isn other thing that kinda annoys me is that they have all these hi-tech ways of opening your phone like retina recognition finger print voice activated etc but they don have most basic thing it annoys he ll out of me that double tap to open it does not exist on this phone they have list of ways to unlock your phone they are all really cool but just want basic to open my phone when its off shouldn be process just double tap screen to turn on pattern lock to open done there are other annoying things but won go into details about it reason giving this stars is because they do have great featureson this phone but texting does suck last sentence for this review unaltered had to changethe spelling on each sentence granger at least ten aspirate times before out period down have fin translating this
screen,display on this phone is incredible was blown away by how much screen they fit into phone no bigger than regular iphone super fast super responsive
screen,love my new samsung display graphics are amazing
screen,big screen but not too wide fits your hand perfectly is exelent cellphone not too big but huge screen for size price but bixby key is kind of annoying
screen,great design fits perfectly in my hand superb display was easy to transfer my data from 950xl excellent photos many features makes it pleasure to use multi window display capability is great
screen,works well touchy screen sides that switch it easily
screen,just have to watch when you get near side it flips screens
screen,it is nice phone have good speed display
screen,screen clarity is excellent noticed screen doesn show smudge marks like my old one
screen,ve owned used samsung phones including captivate note iphones 6s nokia lumia s8 so far has been best ve owned screen is amazing phone is responsive it just feels looks futuristic
screen,awesome screen must get good case because there are two glass on phone love unlocking with iris scan
screen,love size excellent quality all around nice big screen too

screen,like look how fast it is display touch screen is very sensitive all around very good phone
screen,in love with my new samsung galaxy s8 it got beautiful large screen still waiting for my auto-correct to get to know me though seems worse than my previous galaxy
screen,my husband loves this phone he is happy he went with smaller screen
screen,have always had samsung phones of course this is best display is outstanding
screen,may seem like just another phone but it not extremely quick beautiful display
screen,it took me years to update my phone had s3 was not interested learning new phone but love it only thing is that keyboard icons are hard to push because of glass hd screen protector
screen,she upgraded to this one loves it screen clarity feel are awesome extra memory should come in handy
screen,display is excellent very responsive very easy to transfer everything from your old phone adapter cable are included to do this
screen,went from s5 to s8 everything to runs so much faster there is issue with glass screen protectors but that in no-fault of phone its self
screen,went from s5 to s8 everything to runs so much faster there is issue with glass screen protectors but that in no-fault of phone its self
screen,switched from iphone to this samsung galaxy am very happy with phone screen is vibrant like curved look to it haven had any issues with getting set up getting applications installed still getting used to using android but so far loving it
screen,my wife upgraded this from galaxy s5 screen is awesome
screen,had s6 for last years figured it was time for upgrade so far happy with my choice don really care about curved screen but don dislike it hate dedicated bixby button wish that it could be reprogrammed without having to download third-party app
screen,s8 hardware is beauty gorgeous display almost no bezel
screen,screen got freeze after days of use restart it self every minutes
screen,so purchased this phone for my wife took it home was immediately having issues when phone was established on home wi-fi wi-fi would turn off on its own if screen was locked have to be manually turned on took phone to at to discover phone had malware went to return device to best buy manager was rude kept interrupting me when was explaining situation refused to return device told me had to go to original purchase store he stated if he took it back he would have to have geek squad look at it but then refused to have them look at it device was returned at original store with no issues end result is phone had issue got it fixed rude managers don help situations
screen,this is my first phone that is not iphone have only had phone for weeks but have been very happy so far screen on phone is very impressive fingerprint sensor on back takes little getting used to but overall very nice phone
screen,it bit slim but you get used to it had samsung s3 until recently upgraded so way things work on this phone is much different it just takes time getting used to it really like this side window option that given honestly only use my phone for everyday usage nothing fancy ok things ve noticed when using phone for too long it freezes what phone doesnt but because of lack of physical home button it goes kinda crazy just push lock screen wait moment some apps are missing it simple features have study app with bookmark feature where you can select paragraph bookmark it simple yes but this phone doenst do that my gmail also doesn open up my whole mail it hard to explain but it missing something know these are app issues but still just wanted to let you know
screen,love samsung products but this one is one of best screen is flawless size is just right
screen,my s4 went for swim had been reviewing s8 for upgrade for awhile was pleased with ability to retrieve all my info from my old phone including messages screen settings etc it is big change for me but finding it easy to navigate
screen,happy though not with beveled edges they don seem to make glass screen protector for these phones that stay on love new type usb connector though it will take while to rid ourselves of all old devices with usb minis
screen,absolutely love this phone was always android user decided to try apple just couldnt get it tried this new s8 wow totally in love everything ive always wanted more great screen graphics memory programs processes
screen,as expected from samsung flagship phone it is well built specs get job done originally did not like idea of curved edge on both sides but warming up to it objection was over having case that could adequately protect those curves still be functional having screen protector that would not get in way it was decided that would forgo screen protector as many reviews stated that there was issues using edges hope that otterbox case can properly protect screen but guess that is what accidental protections plans are for
screen,can really tell difference with new screen
screen,great phone love screen size easy to use internet
screen,product screen shape does not very well accommodate attachment of screen saver
screen,like playing my games on bigger screen makes game more fun
screen,great hd display fast loading for all apps gorgeous design
screen,very fast compared to my last phone light weight veryg bright vibrant screen still learnijng everythiing it can do
screen,this is awesome phone everything works fine it has big screen in small phone
screen,where do start honestly this phone has so many things about it that love always on display bixby button many cool customizable features just gorgeous display am still learning new things it does every day thank you to stephanie mario blake in forsyth location you are all so great to help
screen,ve never owned phone as nice sleek as this one display is unmatchable is really snappy amoled on screen really makes things pop
screen,upgraded from galaxy s5 to s8 my s5 filled up to point where would have to delete apps just to update hopefully with this storage won have same problem love everything about phone my only gripe is with glass screen protector by adding this lost sensitivity of screen adapting but maybe update will come out to fix issue by allowing you to increase sensitivity
screen,upgraded from s6 not much has changed other than display no buttons it is faster as to be expected
screen,in love wiht this new phone started off with s8 it was too small narrow for me so went back in week to upgrade to s8 screen is big not hard to hold features are fantastic highly recommend this phone
screen,great screen size features upgraded from s5 what difference few years makes in technology now if can only find curved screen shield that works without bubbles will be happy camper
screen,my fiance had s7 wanted to get him new phone since he was complaining about it so preordered him only think he doesn like is curved screen he says it ll break easily but we ll see overall he loves it
screen,after owning s4 it is notable difference in size screen speed of s8
screen,display screen is amazingly beautiful so is user interface
screen,most everything runs smoothly but while recording in 4k video phone get really hot really quick overall it great phone although not crazy about curved glass curve makes for some limited options when shopping for case friendly glass screen protector still wish they offered flat version because like said not crazy over curved edge display it still worth buying though
screen,great display this phone is awesome you should buy it
screen,like bigger phone screen function are better
screen,samsung has done excellent job with new galaxy s8 clear screen excellent connectivity very easy to use
screen,amazing display nice processing speed good aesthetic
screen,amazing display full of features love fact of expandable memory
screen,went from s5 to s8 enjoying new features especially love edge to edge screen size
screen,extremely happy with phone performance capability to do so much except upgrade beautiful screen
screen,love feel of smooth screen tried putting screen protector on it but didn like it so don use one now so far no scratches amazed because just throw it in my purse with my keys sometimes
screen,had phone for few days screen was scratched accidentally thought gorilla glass would help with better scratch protection bixby option still does not work well for me phone is solid reliable easy to look at
screen,love infinity screen no complaints on this phone
screen,there is no android phone better than this top notch specs amazing screen love it
processor,phone it self is really nice has some really nice features loved iris scanner battery seemed to last nice amount for me but within first day of having it it would randomly restart it would happen about 6-10 times day got it swapped out with new phone it did same thing after taking it to samsung in local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it he did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it but no solution yet this seems to be common problem even though it not being widely reported on do search for galaxy s8 restarting it going on weeks since release no comment from samsung see samsung community boards people are calling samsung they are still telling them ve never heard of this ended up returning mine before days
processor,galaxy s8 is fantastic phone it has powerful processor expandable memory is durable against elements only have to minor complaints about phone it super slippery phone is made completely of glass there is no plastic backing grip surface anywhere on phone so be prepared to buy necessary case just so you can hold onto phone bixby button bixby is most useless personal assistant application among all phones you will find yourself meaning to hit power button but wind up pressing bixby button which is right across from power button on accident which starts bixby app while you can turn off access to bixby app when you swipe right on phone app will always start when you click hardwired bixby button there is no way to disable this button functionality in phone best solution ve come up with is to buy case pop out case button that corresponds with bixby button so you cannot physically press it with bixby now out of my life my experience with phone is phenomenal highly recommend phone
processor,replaced my galaxy for this galaxy 8s some features are nice it was easy to learn new navigation system curved edge means have to use plastic screen guard instead of glass one plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils charging cable is shorter than on my galaxy s5 have dropped it times this week because of picking it up from charger cord is too short never dropped my galaxy s5 needs charging daily
processor,have only had s8 for about week after migrating from s5 so im still getting used to it getting familiar with all features so can only give it stars at this point it might be star phone but just don know yet im still not sure what to think about bixby feature need to get more familiar with it to see if it is worthwhile not for my needs so far like phone just fine there definitely performance over s5 as there should be not knocking s5 but newer phones should perform better with more memory faster processors
processor,glad didn have to learn new system from my s6
processor,nice design but hindered by bad operat8ng system great display though
processor,love new operating system do enjoy larger no button screen
processor,definitely upgrade to my s6 edge in display memory processor evidently noticed right away beautiful display very responsive to touch still have to setup bixby but so far so good
processor,upgraded from samsung s4 to s8 absolutely love new phone bigger screen size longer battery life faster processor haven found anything don like about new phone yet
processor,has passed on s6 s7 so my s5 was definitely showing it age this phone rocks got it with included gear vr this phone can handle processing power required for smooth vr experience other than that it samsung so you probably already know what you re getting unless you need to stick with kiddie ecosystem of apple just get this phone
processor,great phone beautiful screen fast processor sleek design way overpriced though
processor,reviewed s8 prior to purchase it was all positive must mostly due to operating systems compatibility nothing at time talked about poor screen craftsmanship phone slipped out of my pocket as was lying on ground working on vehicle phone was in wallet case fall from few inches cracked screen damaged lcd my last three phones have been samsung galaxy repair will be near when parts are available was not offered protection plan if it was presented salesman pushed through it while talking to another salesman about photography may have to switch back to apple
processor,was nervous about not having button on front but hardly notice really like still having buttons on sides for volume control but phone is super sleek fits well in my hand it is operating great has great quality screen would definitely buy again
processor,so far am very pleased with my phone love display it way better than my old iphone it also came with lots of free stuff completely different operating system than apple but didn know much about ios anyway if going to have to learn new system anyway might as well be one that has nicer display more memory
processor,great phone that is compact yet has large screen with great clarity fast processor that does not lag when multi tasking great camera with professional effects screen clarity is unmatched by other phones on market only down side is that bixby button takes getting used to can be easy to hit with intending to change volume setting this is not feature use would be nice if this button could be re-purposed
processor,great camera beautiful display quick processor great phone
processor,great phone battery life is outstanding screen wow just wow s6 had great camera hard to grasp how they made s8 better going from s6 to s8 was simple samsung included smart switch in system apps to make things super easy did transfer via wifi when it was finished all my apps screens looked like they did on s6
processor,newest samsung smart phone with large screen fast processor
processor,would be great except that having fingerprint reader on back is awkward very inconvenient also its placement next to camera lens means that lens always has fingerprints on it constantly needs cleaning octicore processors are fast make for really smooth operation with minimal wait for responses
processor,great size feels good in hand fast processor takes great pictures has good battery life you can even see screen in bright day light
processor,while very apprehensive to leave apple ecosystem found transition very easy after aft android file transfer was loaded very happy with screen camera phone overall
processor,left iphone 6s plus got this phone great size actually smaller phone but same size of iphone 6s plus love screen operating system
processor,amazing brilliant phone samsung never disappoints know every company has its issues but so far that ve had this phone since 21st of april have no complaints processor is fast camera is amazing screen is beautiful plus it water resistant how better can it get def recommend to all samsung fans for first time android users
processor,pros amazing screen fast processor good functionality touch screen responsiveness edge feature is somewhat helpful cons fingerprint scanner location responsiveness camera bottom firing speaker
others,apple guy multiple ipads imacs macbooks but ve never really warmed up to iphone despite all my family having one as well as having my own from work quite honestly longtime blackberry holdout but lack of apps finally got to me almost waited for new keyone but bought this instead am so glad did this phone is truly amazing

others,have had my phone for months now absolutely love it upgraded from g5 haven had any regrets getting another samsung phone
others,samsung carrier locked phones are just worth year before they start getting slow would have preferred to buy unlocked phone instead of carrier locked but due to financing options with att had to stick with it just think twice before going for any samsung smartphones since they have tendency to slow down quickly carrier updates are generation old
others,love this product even better got it for price that couldnt be beat

others,after surprise wave flooded my beach blanket all my stuff was pleasantly surprised to have my phone in perfect working condition after fact two weeks following took spill into pool again working perfectly phone even advised me not to charge thru port until fully dry as moisture was detected features are pretty cool nice sleek however it freezes often enough to annoy me wherein have to hold down buttons until my fingers hurt secs later to restart it wait mins before fully reloaded when say often its been maybe times total in months enough to have gotten annoying but am super active on my phone with apps searching etc so am assuming it has to do with using up my ram needing reboot just like my laptop would very happy with phone staying in galaxy family but finally having some water protection gives alot of peace of mind also was easy to find nice case liked on amazon much cheaper than otterbox liking unicorn beetle brand cases holds tough
others,samsung love it easy to use best buy tech was great

battery,ve had phone for nearly month now love it probably didn need to upgrade as my galaxy s5 was perfectly functional although seemed to be running slower not much of phone-tographer but cameras seem to be big improvement over s5 camera functions too feel more intuitive quicker im not huge fan of curved edges aside from allowing more comfort for hand edge feels more like gimmick than anything it essentially disappears once phone is in case which is almost necessity considering price understand some might find it annoying that fingerprint sensor is now on back of phone but haven yet gotten onboard with biosecurity technology still like my digit pin so can speak to iris scanner facial recognition either was worried about absence of tactile home button but it hasn been issue bixby like biosecurity is something haven found use for yet it exclusive button is very close to volume down button which can be mildly aggravating if you are relying on touch alone to minimize sound speaking of sound speaker is now on bottom of phone as opposed to back as someone who watches listens to good deal of media on my phone find this change from my s5 great improvement as for battery life ve been extremely satisfied so far was very happy with my s5 battery life find that my s8 lasts considerably longer am slightly nervous about not having access to my battery though over two half years used my s5 did have to remove battery handful of times to reset phone due to unresponsiveness glitches another improvement over s5 is lack of plastic back which made that phone feel cheap conversely higher end metal glass back of this phone make it feel incredibly fragile it too bad that something so sleek well-designed requires case to keep it from scratches scuffs cracks advertised infinity screen is non-existent with addition of even slimmest case lastly really like included headphones in comparison to those of s5 they are little more substantial in ear keeping them from popping out also allowing good deal of noise-cancellation cord feels to be made of sturdy metal mesh that comes off as rugged long-lasting
battery,switched from lg g5 phone is very fast so far my battery is lasting longer than day with lot of use left screen on which still looks great as someone else pointed out screen protectors are pain not just zagg one none of them seem to fit slight curve phone is fast looks amazing
battery,long time iphone user switching to far superior galaxy s8 battery life is great even in high performance mode super fast charging don feel like have to ration my battery make my phone wall phone
battery,have always been iphone person whenever ve strayed away from iphone ve always gone back to it after couple weeks but not this time samsung galaxy s8 is awesome coming from iphone plus it took little while to get used to narrowness of s8 but screen size is actually slightly bigger diagonally than iphone plus so didn feel need to get s8 size of this phone is perfect it fits so much better in pockets purses etc than iphone plus camera on s8 is stunning colors are true depth clarity are on point with improvements samsung has made to front-facing camera you don end up looking all distorted like on previous galaxy models s8 is fast not experiencing any lag when quickly switching between apps playing games battery is decent but iphone plus battery was better although it is nice to have couple different power-saving modes on s8 being able to customize everything on s8 is really great so is being able to have all kinds of widgets since last time had android phone years ago there have been so many improvements made to play store apps for apple android seem to basically be same now which is great also feel that am able to make my phone more secure with android as opposed to apple all in all happy with switch made to s8 from iphone
battery,have enjoyed using this phone so much that feel need to write one of my first online reviews my last two phones were iphone iphone enjoyed both very much only thing disliked about either was battery life neither of these phones lasted me full days use which often left me without phone late at night this was huge issue when was out late needed uber to contact friends was something wanted to avoid with my next phone purchase loved ios my iphone six was still working fine minus awful battery life after reading some reviews on iphone decided to look into android phones due to mediocre battery reviews s8 had good reviews for battery life although not best for verizon models moto play but it had best reviews for almost everything else which swayed me best buy also had deal going on when purchased it that made it same price per month as moto z2 play that made decision to buy it much easier user interface is easy to use highly customizable screen is amazing it comes with gigs of storage my last phone had so this was huge for me battery life is incredible ve tried it on two main battery settings high mid both lasted me at least full day my first day with high use heavy downloading on full power lasted me from 8a-1a with over left on mid battery saver mode it had over half battery left ve ended up around on full power since that first day all days referenced were around hours use my phone pretty heavily see biggest drops on apps like reddit groupme youtube phone also charges very quickly never could play games on my last two phones due to storage ve downloaded few including final fantasy all run very smoothly it kind of blowing my mind that one of my favorite playstation games can run so well on phone edge to edge display is as advertised it first thing that draws you in in-store pressure sensitive home button is great ve had no issues even when using glass screen protector finger print sensor is also located in place that apparently bothering many users but have case that makes it very easy to feel where it is so have no complaints went with clear otterbox symmetry because liked way orchid gray back of phone looks wouldn recommend purchasing one of tempered glass screen protectors they sell due to price love glass protectors because accident prone ve been using protector from amazon tempered glass protectors are all getting panned online but ve had no issues be really nervous using this phone without extra protection in regards to my purchasing experience best buy was great had only upgraded phones in verizon stores since my first phone in high school so going to best buy made me slightly wary associates were all incredibly helpful not pushy at all they actually talked me out of purchases was heavily considering s8 for extra battery very glad passed it was way too big in my hands it wouldn have been worth extra hour two of battery life wouldn end up needing was able to easily add phone on to my monthly plan just like at verizon only at half cost overall can imagine there better phone out right now it most unique fun user experience ve had since my first smart phone
battery,wasn planning on upgrading but price at bb was so great couldn help myself it has been great decision as had s7 this phone has awesome battery so fast love it
battery,have always owned android phone for as long as can remember tried apple iphone did try to give phone chance but it wasn for me went back to galaxy s8 couldn be happier am on my phone lot so love how long battery stays charged
battery,long battery life fast need case slippery in hands
battery,hadn upgraded my phone since galaxy s4 because features such as removable battery even upgraded storage had been taken out because my s4 still was working just fine even to this day only real reason upgraded was because of special deal going on with new s8 figured why not even though those two previously mentioned features are not in new phone it actually hasn impacted me like thought would much more improved battery lasts me few days without charging it leads me to believe it will last me quite while down road also going from 16gb storage to gb storage made me not even need extra sd card anyway interface runs very smoothly screen quality is fantastic it might not be worth going from s7 one up but if you re more than couple models back it worth it
battery,love this phone but aspect ratio is little weird when watching movie video with screen in landscape orientation there are vertical black bars on both edges of screen this is minor issue but it worth mentioning great battery life unlock features iris scan is really cool works surprisingly well
battery,read reviews before purchased this phone have to say that this is best phone out in my opinion ve had it for almost weeks now still learning new things battery life is amazing on this phone got body glove case but no screen protector as it really difficult to find one that works with curved screen case only things hate are curved screen size volume really wish samsung would have made flat screen made screen inches instead of inches because believe that sweet spot not too big not too small also wish samsung had provided louder speaker maybe duel speakers at bottom one in ear piece like iphone these are minor issues not enough to lose star over but just believe if these things were done it really would be perfect phone in my opinion
battery,was on fence between iphone samsung samsung clearly is better because android allows me to customize my phone to my needs battery life is great
battery,have to say that this phone has been good upgrade compared to other phones its not loud phone but its decent really like display battery life different features it has another good thing it has not frozen yet am still getting used to edge which makes it hard to find good screen protector for it overall its nice job done by samsung great deal with best buy
battery,extremely happy with this phone bought it on black friday deal offering off couldn be happier battery life of this phone is phenomenal am avid phone user social media snapchat texting spotify etc this battery lasts me hours this is first phone have ever owned that lasts me entirety of day even with how frequently use it screen is beautiful display is next-level extremely impressed so glad chose this over iphone got this phone after already owning galaxy best buy transferred everything from my old phone in minutes this phone is best purchase have made in long time
battery,great phone upgrade from s7 great battery life
battery,best looking phone out there great battery life amazing display performance
battery,ve looked at several devices from samsung this was one that made me jump being that it was perfect balance of screen size battery life internal memory performing better than advertised would purchase this again am quite happy with it
battery,love my new phone battery life is great pictures are awesome very easy to use
battery,this mobile phone is best one on market with all latest features before any other brand never had any problems with battery overheating dieing to soon plus if it did die you have access to inside your phone to change yourself
battery,my last samsung phone had been note really hated touch wiz some other annoying features have always pushed for better value phones but when this one was cheap enough didn have better option reluctantly bight s8 have been really happy touchwiz is no longer laggy phone looks great takes good pictures runs whatever need it to really push phone it battery still lasts fingerprint reader is annoyingly placed but have gotten used to it it is not issue only concern is bixbie button which can now disable but volume keys are now hard to reach not worth docking star though this really is great phone
battery,this phone is reliable battery almost always has lot of power beautiful pics from camera
battery,battery lasts at least day with moderate use phone is water resistant works well software is easy intuitive

battery,great battery life beautiful screen fast processing power are highlights of s8 samsung new personal assistant bixby takes bit of getting used to but it is incredibly valuable once you complete learning curve screen quality is most beautiful have seen on phone yet storage space 64gb is insane adding memory card makes it feel like you can have storage that won run out do miss physical home button that galaxy series has become known for though best buy exclusive blue color is nice light shade of blue that is understated but still sleek noticebale
battery,this was upgrade from galaxy s6 daughter loves phone great battery life sharp clear screen added bonus is that best buy gave us nice-sized gift card for trading in old phone even though it was on it last leg

battery,upgraded from s7 to s8 due to my monthly cost becoming lower there are so many amazing new features on phone yes there was small learning curve used manual cheap book that bought really like bixby it does things that even alexa couldn do battery lasts much longer positives go on only current negatives which is big is that my phone completely froze 2x in past week
battery,great phone great deal battery life needs improving
battery,camera high quality lots of features sound quality excellent samsung apps many useful apps few not so much battery life pretty good but not as good as expected although do use it heavily mostly for pictures marine nav chart apps bixby hate it can uninstall disable button which hit constantly by mistake color can see it under my case but still think it lovely overall love phone quite happy with it when bixby doesn make me mad
battery,went from iphone to galaxy s8 few months ago at first was quite skeptical but it has turned out to be pretty awesome swap battery lasts way longer have had less problems while traveling
battery,look of screen is awesome love slight curve on edges feel of it in hand battery is not too bad usually can make it through full day without having to charge if you do have to charge though quick charging is very fast love this phone
battery,had been waiting for note to come out when it finally did it was not worth cost difference from s8 s8 plus s8 fits better in my hand easier to use that s8 plus camera is good but not as easy to quickly launch as old note low light motion is not as good as hoped for takes great pictures just not magic use my phone all day long battery hold up well
battery,samsung galaxy s8 battery last longer than s7
battery,this phone is everything have grown to expect from samsung fast sleek powerful awesome battery life
battery,big improvement over s7 wish it had removable battery but other than that am happy
battery,great phone great battery life great screen love highly recommend it
battery,this phone has great features performance has good battery life excellent picture audio
battery,this phone has been great it was about cheaper than comparable iphone it has all features plus it is water prrof battery is big step up from older models
battery,battery life is great usually only have to charge once day camera takes great pictures video looks fantastic on this screen
battery,great phone features battery charge time is great as well as amount of usage between charges
battery,had edge made jump to as my older phone was having pretty bad battery life this phone is so sleek nice aside from aesthetics specs are pretty awesome too generally use for photos texting calls web browsing light gaming does well for all need battery is great can extend memory with sd card bluetooth is plus one only gripe is that samsung removed ir blaster so can no longer use my phone as remote for my non-smart tv not that bad in grand scheme of things
battery,love infinity screen on s8 this phone is fast graphics are amazing when taking photos great battery life
battery,this phone is not only jammed with bells whistles many of which will never use but basic features are best ever can seem to get battery below when use phone for full day volume of my calls alerts are loud enough that can hear them conversation both on off speaker phone is totally understandable on both ends
battery,battery life is much better than my previous galaxy my only complaint is that since it is edge phone you need to buy separate glass protection film most don fit correctly but overall happy with my phone
battery,really happy with phone screen is beautiful make sure you get case battery life is good as well overall great phone
battery,what can say that hasn already been said echo all positives with this phone battery life is big improvement over my previous s4 stepping up onboard storage to 64gb is welcome relief 16gb is not enough today app sizes curved screen looks cool is surprisingly less annoying than was expecting it to be but still can be difficult to navigate when swiping from edge of screen from time to time dragging to pull up full screen notifications my biggest complaint is non-standard non-16 aspect ratio for phone nice for reading articles pain for watching video casting your screen to monitor car stereo wish they would include option to cast to traditional aspect ratio
battery,upgraded from s5 loved that thing sad no built in ir to use for tv remote can use 3rd party mobile hotspots with android later now thought battery life would have been slightly better
battery,this works out for me my family battery life is fantastic
battery,love love this phone so many fabulous features like bixby long battery life finally can go all day without worrying need to be near charger screen camera are amazing takes awesome pictures haven tested water resistance feature but sure will one day get this phone
battery,omg bixby you suck go to app store purchase samsung app disabler turn all bixby features off trust me in fact turn off all bloat ware that this phone is jammed packed with you can get full list of apps safe to disable if you google it button is in location where no matter what you will push button open app other than that phone is great fast crisp hd movies games everything in between can slow down this phone very responsive battery life is way better than expected wireless charging is another great feature my dock is on my nightstand so don have to fidget with plugging it in if need to answer use it if they placed bixby button on top of phones edge would give it stars but since now have useless button on my phone give it stars will try figure ok it if can make button do another function later awesome phone
battery,new phone is awesome can say enough about battery life
battery,best phone ve ever had by far battery life is outstanding camera has so many great features is as good as advertised still don really get draw to infinity screen though
battery,nice phone with long lasting battery screen resolution is great phone takes awesome photos
battery,this was upgrade for my gs6 edge so far it does everything my old phone did but better battery life is much better
battery,overall it is fast phone with lots of options great price with off curved screen at edges makes it tough to use some websites battery could be bigger last complaint fat finger keyboard on this phone more than any phone have ever owned corrected words in this post
battery,am fan so far looks cool functions easily great camera bixby works very well longevity of phone is yet to be determined but battery life is decent now it has plenty of built in memory for most 64gb
battery,loving this phone it slimmed down from s7 edge battery life is great glad upgraded
battery,battery life on this phone is fantastic can go two full days with regular use before need to charge it
battery,love this phone so easy to use has tons of storage battery life is great too
battery,great camera great phone overall work in office that has poor cell coverage s8 is much better than my previous phone it could have better battery life though
battery,ve had phone for about month love it it got great battery life especially given built in power-saving modes excellent camera all of my favorite applications run like lightning
battery,we upgraded from s4 no comparison better increased battery life love edge screen capabilities great for watching videos
battery,faster cleaner access better battery life wider screen to edge makes for better reading of email experience
battery,bought this couldn be happier battery lifeis amazing
battery,bought new phone for my wife she loves speed of phone long battery life
battery,love this phone its fast camera is fantastic battery live is just fine solid package
battery,it awesome super fast battery life is amazing don like bixby popping up but will figure out how to disable it eventually
battery,this phone has some great features but if it is broken it is worthless after other smartphones that were easy to protect with cases screen protectors this one was difficult what dealer doesn tell you is that edge screen is so fragile that dropping it just one time will break it that being said it is hard to find case that will protect edge it is also hard to find screen protector made of glass that will fit properly give same touch ability they should stress that you must have insurance then you probably will have to pay service fee camera is great storage great battery life so so don count on bixby to be reliable it doesn always come up when you want it to sometimes starts talking when phone is sitting idle if it had flat screen would recommend it but not with edge never again
battery,really wanted to love this phone design is beautiful camera is beyond fantastic but cons outweigh pros microphone speaker is absolute garbage don have bluetooth in my car rely heavily on quality of speaker though it was good for playing music every call was on person on other end could not hear word said ended up having to use cell handheld not so safe sound silent modality couldn easily figure out how to have timer alarm go off when phone was on silent vibrate mode no good accessories ordered about different screen protectors cases off of amazon from reputable companies none seemed to work with phone battery life battery was generally great except for when using gps then battery drained within few hours it just not as great as expected it to be my disappointing purchase turned into return better pay restocking fee than continue paying for impractical phone
battery,picked up second s8 for our account best buy had it on sale it was almost half of price paid at product launch s8 has excellent battery which lasts over full day with medium usage display is awesome
battery,great phone with great pictures battery last forever
battery,upgraded to from it has lot of same features so it was easy to adjust to like smart transfer feature good phone overall only complaint is battery have to charge it every night
battery,this phone it great call clarity ease of use battery life look feel are all wonderful on gripe have besides obvious poor placement of fingerprint scanner right next to camera seriously is weird screen aspect ratio tall thin phone screen often places vertical bars on either side of viewable screen when watching movie video in landscape mode what point of infinity screen if you re no using all of that space also curved edges of phone can sometimes make it hard to use horizontal scroll on webpage use some video player features because scroll bar buttons are displayed on curved edge in landscape mode don always pick up your finger presses overall this is great looking performing phone but these two minor issues can be annoying
battery,this was to replace my wife s3 aside from normal learning curve annoyance of having to set things up this phone is very nice great camera good battery life wireless charging were great features but kicker was price thank you best buy
battery,what can say this android smart phone is best ve own on market to-date phone displays crisp picture produces good sound for such small device camera takes unbelievable pictures oh it has awesome battery life too
battery,great phone nice upgrade from gs6 battery life is good phone is her responsive 4k screen is beautiful no complaints just wanting nice glass screen protector so far no one makes full adhesive protector
battery,love this new phone it does all things well with minimal battery use at end of day busy with calls texts reviewing email it still retains over have it battery capacity display is crystal clear enlarged with wrap around screen
battery,switch back from iphone again cz my iphone 6s got crash screen times in row during past half year s8 is durable solid build much better than iphone throw away my phone occasionally result is s8 survived but iphone broke everytime good speed okay battery nice design
battery,ve been loyal samsung customer for several years now love this phone coming from s7 edge this phone is thinner lighter not so bulky originally got s8 it ended up being too big so exchanged it shouldn need to use guy sized hands to hold phone at times battery life is pretty good little better than s7 have orchid gray one looks gray blue silver light purple at times who picks colors for these phones anyway anyway camera is amazing it is fast call quality is really good definitely recommend
battery,had s6 before this can honestly say samsung outdid themselves again great battery life very fast couldn ask for better phone because don know what they could improve on
battery,love this phone still exploring all features great camera easy to use love screen size battery life is good
battery,great screen amazing camera tons of options battery life has been great
camera,camera is great phone apps are easy to work with loving it better than my iphone 6s
camera,so was really excited to get this phone it looks great it fast call clarity is superb screen size is amazing camera is top notch but screen has already cracked phone has not been dropped yet like to think take good care of it noticed small spec in screen one afternoon it got worse over next few days now it runs up down entire screen honestly have no idea what did to make this happen guess now am stuck with it for more months luckily none of functionality seems lost so am still enjoying it for most part
camera,decided time price were right to upgrade from my galaxy s5 which had for about three years to s8 overall am pleased with it compared to s5 s8 is thinner narrower made of slick shiny guerrilla glass this might be good for smaller hands to hold but for me this phone required case for better grip so after week of use decided to purchase urban armor gear monarch case which provides right amount of width grip as well protection still fits in my pocket without being bulky picture is bright clear even on lowest setting external speaker at bottom of phone sounds surprisingly good too you just have to remember not to keep your hand over it you ll muffle sound of course you could also use enclosed earbuds provided by akg your own as this phone has headphone jack calls ve made so far have come in loud clear use retina scan to unlock phone it works very well so far also plan to get fast charge pad but for now using fast charge cord it came with just few suggestions for best buy have few sample cases at display table so customers can compare feel of phone both with without case found out my best buy credit card is not supported on samsung pay android pay even though it has citi logo called samsung pay help desk was told card was not supported because it was issued by best buy rather than citi so am hoping best buy can lobby for all its credit card members to get best buy credit card included with samsung pay android pay know would use that app
camera,when samsung announced coral blue color my wife just had to have it what great upgrade for s6 superfast gorgeous screen wireless charging is awesome camera head shoulders above s6 may get s8 for myself
camera,this was upgrade from s4 transfer of contacts done in store was incomplete but app found easily transferred all contacts from s4 to s8 camera has some cool features notification sounds are all different than previous phone so there is learning curve love blue color
camera,great phone with super camera amazing display but you will have no problem at all using it with one hand very recommended
camera,phone is easy to use great camera light in weight
camera,so far have really liked phone upgraded from s7 it has been good transition was concerned about phone being too bulky but its pretty much same size other than height infinity screen curved edges make it hard for cases to fit just right but at least there is lifeproof for it otherwise phone is great it is super fast camera is incredible it almost freaked me out how hd recording is if were to change anything on phone it would be bixby button bixby itself it seems like waste of button space on my phone rather button start google assistant
camera,great camera great video great low light performance lots more storage than my previous 16gb phone love that can add micro sd card curved screen is gimmick that don find that useful but curved screen makes it very difficult to get good screen protector that doesn interfere with touch screen doesn fall off doesn peel up when swiping from edge have had to restart it few times when encounter glitches that make phone hang otherwise phone is great
camera,am loving this new phone camera on both front back are exceptional call quality is great love look feel of this phone screen is just awesome love all new security features on this phone
camera,phone is easy to use great camera clean pictures applications easier to use
camera,this phone has amazing camera takes some of best pictures ever absolutely love this phone

camera,coral blue color is stunning exclusive to best buy fans of samsung products android phones will not be disappointed in quality of phone in performance camera imaging functionality apple users this phone will make you want to convert
camera,this phone does it all it looks great with it slick form factor there no lag when use it camera is great there ton of shortcuts with hard buttons everything is pretty seamless there nothing you can do with hard button for bixby being there but at least there are apps to change its use have no complaints camera is top notch
camera,s8 is very good cell phone camera takes nice pictures display is sharp clear accessing web pages is rapid having many sites open at same time is no problem my main complaint is that when button keyboard character displays at edge of screen trying to get item to display may require several touches due to curvature of screen edge of screen is good for display purposes but awkward for input
camera,enjoy my galaxy phone but camera is hard to work with protective case over it my internet signal is worse than my galaxy
camera,upgraded to s8 from s5 with no hesitation once knew phone had qualcomm chip it was between s8 sony xperia premium s8 had slim profile better screen to body ratio screen resolution was not deal changer since it just phone not tv great quality phone that fast have been using face recognition with back up pin to unlock phone face recognition doesn register as often as like to trouble shoot this go change your picture in unlock settings to common position you typically gold to unlock your phone recommend playing with your picture as you ll see when phone takes it but overall great buy interested in bixby release
camera,well was on edge of giving up on android as whole after horrible experience with galaxy s7 edge told myself was going back to apple however s8 managed to get my attention am glad it did because it is best phone you can get on android it hardly ever slows down hardware like camera is amazing

camera,like phone lot super fast like no home button screen camera is amazing too
camera,was nervous about upgrading to this phone with negative reviews online about screen back easily cracking with short drop sitting on it very rough on my phones tend to drop it at least once day put tech case on it over month later it still looks brand new screen width picture is amazing it seems clearer than s7 while tried bixby but ran into too many snags having to program shortcuts yelling at it nothing by then it going off when we are having conversation in car google does everything want voice response is almost perfect google works better on this phone than s7 too also love edge menu option use it all time for my most used apps ll never go to iphone with ability to customize this phone also take pics with my voice
camera,love this phone had galaxy never liked that one this has great features that you can use every day like finger print in back picture feature where you just say smile it snaps shot great
camera,phone has been very good but still struggle at times with new finger print sensor also wish back buttons would stay on screen full time unless turn option off love camera speed of phone

camera,this great phone love quality of video infinity screen gives you so much more picture bixby is nice feature not sure it needed dedicated button biometrics are just ok sometimes they work other times takes while to get working especially facial recognition kind of defeats purpose if have to enter code
camera,this phone looks great is easy to use camera takes great pictures screen is vibrant charge lasts all day only problem had is ubs type connector did not fit salesman said it was manufacturing defect bought new charging cord everything is fine that was lot better than screwing around sending cord back to samsung best buy deal on this phone makes it no brainier thanks best buy
camera,love this phone easy to use pictures are amazing you will have to download some picture apps from samsung to get best pictures but they are all free
camera,in two weeks had this phone it became apparent that there are many technical issues with this phone sure it pretty has amazing picture but it constantly freezes requiring soft restart it get hot surprise surprise has touchscreen issues it also seemed slower than my previous phones not quick response returned it just kept using my old phone
camera,could update with grate deal camera is amazing

camera,best phone on market great camera great design runs smooth fast
camera,this is great phone in every aspect no features lacking beautiful design great camera
camera,would recommend this phone it has great camera apps
camera,this is good phone for daily use lots of memory space camera is great
screen,this phone is awesome no matter what way you put it design is freakin beautiful awesome screen thin it fast everything yoou want in smartphone well worth money
screen,very nice phone it latest flagship phone from samsung it does not disappoint screen is beautiful performance is snappy usb-c port is convenience importantly to me new samsung s8 s8 support video-out via usb-c port you need to buy usb-c to hdmi adapter separately though
screen,as always galaxy s8 is step forward for mobile technology though some of choices they made are rather bizarre what do admire is new super amoled display which works well in almost any lighting situation without manually adjusting your brightness also like other typical things like external memory good screen size 4k resolution unfortunately as mentioned previously there are few things not totally comfortable with for instance edge screen has been nuisance while attempting to type until had to turn it off bixby commands are way too easy to trigger for example if you re trying to adjust volume of something your finger slips you turn bixby on swipe left on your home screen too much bixby turns on don get me wrong like bixby just wish that it wasn so intrusive finally for one of my biggest gripes they changed aspect ratio of phone you see instead of expanding in both dimensions galaxy s8 decided to expand only vertically while this means that it can better fit in places like cup holders pants pockets it also means that they changed aspect ratio to wouldn have as much of issue with this if more things were integrated with that lot of apps are stuck in changing that could break application this means that of screen is wasted on black space this is something hope they go back on with galaxy s9 overall think that galaxy s8 is just okay which is bad for samsung
screen,phone is beautiful sleek even some of typical bloatware is uninstallable s8 so far is fabulous with plenty of awesome new features tweaks that being said below is link to top of line screen protector that best buy stocks for s8 do not buy this screen protector read reviews you won regret it http www bestbuy com site zagg-invisibleshield glass-curve screen-protector for-samsung galaxy-s8 transparent skuid
screen,really enjoy phone wish there was option for no edge screen cracked screen in first two weeks thank goodness it still works because geek squad insurance says can get replacement yet one month so far with shattered screen being held together with screen protector
screen,galaxy s8 is beautiful phone with few flaws that consumers should be made aware of fingerprint sensor is not in ideal location however it works great for accessing notification menu curved glass also causes screen protectors to not it here to surface very well also big-selling point is bixby but it is not functioning as promised
screen,this phone is easy to use looks sleek has amazing screen is several times more powerful than apples new phone apple will probably have this tech on market in about years charge for it you could get all that now at fraction of price
screen,this is my 3rd phone from galaxy line s3 s6 were my 1st 2nd even though first two were perfectly fine performed well this one far out does them it taking me some getting used to not having actual physical home button to get to home screen default location of chrome shortcut button happens to be exactly where my apps button is on my s6 these aren negatives at all edge seems fine although really haven looked at it much yet bixby button function is well placed but haven looked at it much yet either best buy employee was great samsung representative in best buy store was great there are actual official samsung repair centers in select best buy stores didn know this until after purchased my phone so while not negative web site could do better job of letting people browsing samsung devices know that there is such option with that new information in mind decided to switch my phone protection to geek squad plan instead of one offered by my carrier hope never need to use it but am content that can go to best buy store to take care of it excellent phone excellent customer service by both best buy employee samsung representative excellent protection plan option excellent best buy incentive my carrier had none except if traded in my old phone which didn want to do
screen,liked my phone is overall smooth sturdy but little knock on curved side of screen caused it to crack wish had it cover protected on day one
screen,great upgrade from my s5 which has been feeling slow clunky nice slim phone awesome screen lots of new features
screen,this is great phone but curved edges are not asset buttons near edges are tricky to push due to curve options for covers to protect phone are also limited due to curved screen require glass screen protector which makes keys less sensitive cover that does not come up around edge of screen to protect it in case of fall
screen,this phone is fast has huge memory looks great with curved edges it takes while to get used to fact that there no physical home button but on-screen button works just as well if you hold that area where button for 1-2 seconds while screen is off it turns on screen just like it would with physical home button great product overall
screen,still learning all new features no problems at this point other than curved screen doesn take glass protector shield very well will look at flexible plastic protector to see if it any better
screen,this product has very few noticeable changes from s7 except now it has curved screen wasn really in favor of this feature my s7 was great phone assume this will be too time will tell
screen,beautiful feels nice performs well so far it is still new but it is very nice we are quite pleased with it so far speedy very nice display feels great
screen,nice phone curved screen is great for pics but bit of pain to put screen protector on inductive charging is great too great upgrade to older galaxy models
screen,known fragility issues screens case are cracking with without dropping with protective cases screen protectors do your research have always loved galaxy phones but this one is different buyer beware
screen,loved phone more features than could handle phone was little narrow for my liking coming from s5 display was nice sharp overall phone was really nice to use had it for about days before returned it only down side to phone was charging adapter phone does not use standard samsung charging connection but instead you have to use tiny adapter on all your cords that is only reason gave it four out of five stars returned it for s7 edge
screen,love style color also full screen edge to edge
screen,samsung s8 is thing of beauty great design feel in hand screen is awesome phone is super fast
screen,phone is great easy to use load apps screen is large enough to see but not too big to put in pocket
screen,great phone had s6 passed buying s7 bought this one instead glad waited great phone clear screen easy to navigate
screen,screen size great for watching video hard to use with one hand good photos
screen,great phone love screen size never had problem with android phoness
screen,my wife recently upgraded our galaxy s5 to s8 phone is overall nice improvement one gripe so far is both of our s8 phones don deal well with glass screen protectors screen sensitivity is greatly reduced with glass type protector so much so that ended up removing my glass screen protector our s5 both had glass screen protector without issue upon doing some research we are not only ones with this issue on s8
screen,this phone is best iteration of galaxy series could take leave curved edges but speed performance clarity of this phone are spectacular add in water resistance expandable memory headphone jack always-on info display you have great phone
screen,this phone case has good protection but makes touchscreen little difficult
screen,beautiful design display is best ive seen from smart phone cant complain
screen,love phone itself android version on it is extremely easy to use very stable only complaint have is that screen is very easy to crack curved edges make it necessary to have phone case so you are not accidentally pressing things on side of your screen all time
screen,smoothest fastest os ve felt on phone batter lasts full day on one charge screen is like butter
screen,always been android fan had nexus 6p decided to upgrade to galaxy s8 but it wasn upgrade love phone design style features but just don think it will be as reliable bullet proof as nexus 6p was have only had galaxy s8 for months it seems to be getting worse with issues phone freezes randomly during various things occasionally it will unfreeze but times out of it requires me to force soft reset by holding volume down power button to force restart have done full factory reset times replaced external sd card ran it without sd card no change ran it factory stock with no apps installed it may freeze up trying to open pandora it may freeze up after call stay stuck in call screen not even allowing you to answer calls back from person it just dropped call from samsung has built in app for help but expert help suggests all stuff have already tried next step is to send it back to samsung for replacement which would leave me without phone that not viable solution right now since run business android oreo is supposed to be out in next couple months really hope it fixes whatever issue is happening if not have to bite bullet send it start from scratch again ps nexus 6p got passed down to my son he managed to drop it twice crack screen dump class of soda on it it still running strong not missing beat
screen,best phone have ever had dropped twice with case cracked screen both times samsung is fixing over local quotes to fix over
screen,s8 is my first android phone have been iphone user for past years was getting sick of apple way of being best but not really wanted something new change of pace s8 was phone was looking for display is stunning phone has multitude of capabilities however there are few shortfalls to phone first is that android technology does not incorporate percentage indicator for bluetooth devices while this may seem picky one does not like their headphones dieing on them in middle of great workout secondly bluetooth is not what it cracked up to be my iphone had much longer range for its bluetooth could play my wireless speaker in basement while standing on my first floor it would be clear s8 breaks up as soon as go to second floor overall great phone but needs some improvement
screen,cellphone itself is very impressive by its look it screen
screen,reviews claiming this is best phone available are probably true phone is more advanced than this user only irritant is screen often covers back arrow at bottom so you always have to move screen edge up to show arrow fairly irritating
screen,really like this phone edge screen is very cool speaker is on bottom of phone not back so you don have to turn it over my only complaint is location of bixby button my thumb always ends up pushing it when putting phone into sleep mode otherwise would give it stars
screen,love way screen wraps around edge of phone another great feature is being able to hide navigation bar when you want if not you can lock it to stay on bottom of screen
screen,screen prone to cracking with minor contact best buy did not stand behind product but simply referred to carrier
screen,phone is awesome but screen scratches way to easy
screen,great phone so far bought it for my father which is his first smart phone he loves features screen finger print scanner states phone feels just right in his hand easy to manuvear with other hand no issues so far
screen,love bigger screen increased storage capacity
screen,got this phone for my wife who loves it big enough screen finally phone that she has not had issues with
screen,powerful phone with nice clear screen very fast with lot of memory
screen,this smartphone does so many things it is amazing ve had good luck on transmit receive in mountainous area where there is difference in performance but get tired of so many ads for stuff not interested in programs don want good features don want full screen taking away back up home screen buttons when want to keep them on not enough info to get it back
screen,love this phone my only complaint is home screen button seems to have disappeared after recent update on certain apps
screen,great screen large enough to see pics but small enough for short fingers processing time is excellent lots of internal storage sound call quality is great no complaints
screen,this is best phone ve ever owned good sound clarity great screen good connectivity really couldn be happier
screen,this is great phone only thing can think of is that screen is weak dropped mine in parking lot screen shattered
screen,love phone only bad thing can say is curved screen can be annoying at times
screen,phone is fast as expected but screen is not up to par bought bi-fold type phone screen protector phone is weeks old credit card in bi-fold slot has scratched phone screen screens are not impressive will scratch easily you better get screen protector you will be sorry
screen,bought this because like to listen to music while my phone is charging refused to pay for iphone new wireless ear buds love curved screen way glass goes all way to edge plus it is perfect size--it maximizes screen size but is still easy to use with one hand reaching from corner to corner
screen,get lifeproof case glass screen protectors are terrible due to curved screen
screen,beautiful phone all around slippery phone that needs tough case invisishield-type screen protector cracked screen will cost you 300-400 to repair if you get insurance you pay deductible
screen,great phone easy to navigate like sharpness of screen
screen,works verily easily great display runs quickly sound is great
screen,samsung s8 is amazing upgraded from s5 what difference if you buy one make sure you get case friendly screen protector if screen protector goes too far over edge case wants to push screen protector off
screen,got this for my son as birthday gift upgrade from his s5 feels high quality love screen size best buy had best deal going look out apple may switch to samsung
screen,top notch screen with beautiful color apps look great super fast
screen,great phone everything works as well as it should only thing don like is that screen protector doesn work with this phone as it makes areas of phone unresponsive to my normal touch
screen,love s8 has lot if great new features love edge to edge screen it not as wide as my old s5 which is great for someone with small hands
screen,colors on screen are vivid bright easy to see night setting that dims screen as darkness falls it makes viewing in dark much easier on eyes hides blue light that is apparently not good if you want to sleep at night
screen,screen is so clear bigger then my old phone love detail in it
screen,not one to purchase latest tech but rather older versions however received no-brainer deal from best buy to get this phone with verizon plan this phone does everything as expected performs well fast processing great visuals also enjoy storage space because listen to lot of music podcasts maintain many files my only negatives are as follows very slippery screen fades out to sides sometimes cuts images buttons off bit headjack is on bottom which tends to get in my way in exercising holding too often little things like screen not transitioning when turned upside down that may be in settings that haven found yet
screen,ve had s8 for about month it has many improved features am disappointed in more complicated method for screen mirroring
screen,nice sleek easy to use just not crazy about screen curved corners
screen,this phone is much better then sound screen are nice
screen,cool phone but do not like edge screen it to hard to type if you have big hands
screen,we got new s8 for my wife her s4 was shot she is enjoying new phone everything works as it should call quality is very nice screen looks great phone is very fast
screen,dropped my s8 while pulling it out of my pocket screen shattered so bad it is not usable two repair shops quoted for screen replacement plus two week wait guess samsung cant get enough screens shipped out fast enough only had phone for days interweb is full of s8 owners who have had same problem if you dont mind extra month it is fantastic phone
screen,decided to switch from apple this is huge upgrade from my iphone phone is bit tall even with my long fingers it can be hard to reach top haven found email app that like as much as apple email other than that really like it having full keyboard is great screen is incredible definitely takes some getting used to as have never used android device before so far glad switched
screen,it fast beautiful sleek it has so many features works amazingly my daughter has it dropped it hasn damaged yet did buy case screen protector which highly recommend doing with that scree
screen,glad purchased this phone my droid mini after years was slow this phone is much faster display is excellent even though samsung features are slightly different than moto it was easy switch
screen,it dandy am very happy with screen it is easier to use can customize product more to my liking it is durable all good things
screen,great phone love storage screen resolution curved edges cause inadvertent button touch once in while but have gotten used to it
screen,my first phone that is most current version lovely screen very good looking pics videos works well with no problems so far
screen,only complaint is trying to find case screen cover
screen,like most everyone today have used several varieties of smartphones over years iphones lg moto am really impressed with quality of s8 overall pleasure get from using it everything feels seamless display is gorgeous understand that phone is covered in glass coating so bought wallet case that keeps entire phone covered when not in use not huge user of fingerprint scanner don even care to try bixby so can really comment on those aspects enjoy customization of android s8 is cream of crop in android market my wife has iphone which is fantastic phone but with screen headphones android functionality feel s8 is superior device
screen,really loving this phone like having bigger screen than my old phone but it still easy to hold have have small hands some of bigger phones are difficult for me to use one handed but not this one beautiful high resolution screen is easy on my eyes runs fast smooth
screen,decided to upgrade from s5 it is so much faster it is really nice bought two that day apple screen is fantastic everything exceeds what want it for
screen,this is second of two galaxy s8 phones purchased my wife loves it it larger screen than old galaxy s4 we had but much better quality images having little larger screen is great we ve had no problems with either phone would definitely buy again glad we waited so long for upgrade because this is great phone
screen,over time hoping samsung galaxy s8 becomes five star product it obviously has glorious screen features galore apprehensive about durability of screen based on other reviews ll update my post in six months so
screen,really like this phone screen is incredible-both clear large headphones that come with it are outstanding quality multiple security options are pretty impressive albeit almost too much had heard some negative things regarding bixby assistant software but think it works well my only knock on it so far is back casing being pretty scratch prone haven had phone long it shows some of hairline scratches now in market for protective case when hoped to not need one thinking purely for condition for trade in value overall would have no hesitation buying this phone over over again samsung has stepped up their game once again
screen,phone screen cracked when in my pocket should have read reviews that said it was very easy to crack
screen,am very happy with my new samsung s8 which recently upgraded from s7 overall slimmer width fits better in hand screen resolution is even better than s7
screen,had radio station app on my s4 that was transferred to s8 app doesn work right on s8 samsung rep says can do anything about that have app people fix it hard to turn on by pressing on screen front but otherwise everything works good
screen,this is not my first samsung smartphone but it sure is best one beautiful screen easy to hold in my hand very responsive to touch really like ability to add sd card in order to upgrade memory was able to purchase during bestbuy sale so saved over versus purchasing exact same phone directly from my carrier could not be happier with my purchase
screen,phone has great screen great features only bought should of bought went from note love this phone
screen,awesome product from samsung infinite screen is best have seen awesome product for first time after samsung galaxy go for it
screen,display is mesmerizing not huge fan of virtual home button but that easy thing to get used to
screen,this is my 3rd s8 already dropped cracked screen on so far
screen,samsung s8 has amazing screen it is super fast love new bixby assistant feature
screen,very sleek even with case it fits nicely in my pocket very fast great screen resolution only down side is height wear large gloves so have slightly larger than average hand can reach whole screen while only using one hand they used to try to make phones as small as possible soon we ll all be carrying screens with us
screen,absolutely love this phone screen is gorgeous it is quick powerful great deal from best buy better than what can get from verizon
screen,upgraded to s8 from s6 not as bulky screen is not as wide rounded edge is different takes little time to adjust to new feel
screen,this s8 is pretty amazing great visibility bright beautiful screen screaming fast
screen,finally decided to upgrade my dying s5 was not disappointed with s8 do enjoy beautiful screen it runs much smoother than my three year old phone so far it has been great besides usual samsung quirks that have experienced with all my samsung phones
screen,so far like it takes some time to get use to home button not as bulky as screen has got me little worried but ll just have to be careful with it
screen,have always been iphone guy was looking for change of pace dediced to give this phone try design of this phone is fantastic large screen in not so large phone very nice phone on other hand if new iphone is basically same design as galaxy will be going back to apple am very simple guy like simple phone simplicity reliability are my two biggest wants android phones have way to many bells whistles that just don need
screen,love my new samsung galaxy s8 upgraded from galaxy s3 yes you read that right s3 to new samsung s8 huge upgrade for me in all years that had owned s3 since never had problem it so knew that once price dropped on s8 would purchase one it was so worth wait my new s8 is like mini computer crystal clear screen takes great photos has so many awesome features ve had it for week can seem to put it down if you are on fence go for it you won be disappointed
