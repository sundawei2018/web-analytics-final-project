battery,upgraded from iphone 6s battery lasts much longer great product overall just new ios was crashing all fixed now
battery,so far so good with iphone battery lasts long time compared to old iphone
battery,hope battery lasts longer than 6s has recently like updated camera features
battery,like updated camera features hope battery hold charge longer than old phone
battery,switched to apple from samsung for convenience my car is apple friendly it sounded like good reason at time happy with phone battery life apps so forth just prefer samsung over apple if you re apple lover you ll love this phone
battery,great phone glad to be away from large plus size battery life seemed better on plus but still get over day on this one so nothing to be concerned about
battery,battery life appears to be excellent phone is lightning fast takes excellent pictures haven found anything do not like about it rated stars based on reviews read that glass back can easily be broken not even going to take chance so it went from shelf into otterbox
battery,battery life is not any better than iphone6 had
battery,had while this isn huge step forward it def marked improvement over my love stereo speakers improved battery just overall performance didn want to spend money on very happy with this
battery,until you have extra power you don know what you re missing in today phone usage we spend time on social media news sports sites so clarity of sound picture are great battery life will knock your socks off best phone yet
battery,very responsive easy to utilize love new features from upgraded ios operating system especially increase in battery life do not have to utilize external battery as was needed with iphone fully recommend for others wanting new iphone without spending extremely high price let iphone work out kinks before switching
battery,good camera great battery life another happy iphone user
battery,very satisfied with speed battery life highly recommend
battery,purchased phone couple weeks ago it has worked great very easy to figure out has awesome camera battery life is good as well
battery,this iphone is little faster than 6s had also battery lasts longer otherwise it is pretty much same
battery,battery life on this phone is great can go day without charging phone that with heavy use
battery,love my new iphone no cracks like my old battery lasts all day
battery,easy to use program goodbattery life superb camera screen resolution
battery,phone is great battery life is best ve seen from iphone yet also glass seems to be stronger time will tell love they want back to there original black shade
battery,would not bother with upgrading if you have iphone 6s better my battery on my 6s was not lasting as long as would like so decided to upgrade don feel like anything earth shattering came of it in hindsight it would probably have been better to just replace battery on my 6s having said that there is nothing wrong with this phone but it was expensive purchase for not that much more utility it does fee nicer to hold though
battery,i-phone is up to task little pricey but attractive solid device with very good battery response like then size screen resolution is great design change for headphones was unnecessary but at least they give you adapter
battery,phone very seldom used battery won hold charge
battery,great phone too many options to mention great battery life camera is crazy good
battery,if you have iphone earlier this is worthy upgrade battery life is noticeably faster than my iphone there bit of learning curve getting used to new home button but it worth upgrade if you re eligible for it
battery,my biggest complaint about was battery life no more complaining is awesome charges quick doesnt drain immediately
battery,have had iphones love way they just work know many of android phones compete maybe even have more features have thought about switching at times thing that keeps me coming back is incremental improvements to great phone that works breadth of app store is incomparable iphone isn much different from previous generation but it does seem to be lot faster it has good battery life miss headphone jack but am finding ways to work around change
battery,was so disappointed in battery life ve shut off all that not necessary don use yet battery doesn last long need to keep it in low battery mode put it in airplane mode when not using it my old iphone had better battery only thing better than my old phone is camera but it not like taking professional pictures that needed better camera by this time apple should have fantastic product phone has only been out one week already they have update very disappointed in this phone that is that expensive
battery,phone feels behaves lot like battery size etc but glass back gives it nice look pretty solid phone all in all if you want to retain touch id sensor
battery,owned apple had trouble with it am ever so sorry bought battery doesn hold charge contacts touch letter it brings up who ever very poor
battery,probably not worth it if you re upgrading from iphone but if you re doing verizon payment plan why not right upgrades are faster processor wireless charging this method charges very slowly only beneficial overnight think faster cable charging can usually get battery life in about hour slightly better camera that really it upgraded from that iphone se that seemed very fast it ran same processor as 6s mean honestly at certain point faster processors won matter glass back is very pretty but outer rim is still aluminum so it is very prone to dents everyone is waiting for iphone anyway haha
battery,traded my son iphone for iphone battery last much longer everything runs smoother faster another happy purchase from best buy
battery,haven had iphone since my 4s decided to switch to samsung now back to iphone love it battery life is fantastic use it listening to music about hrs at work after hr shift have battery life still charge phone every other day it kool not having to worry if phone will run out of battery

screen,new iphones are underwhelming its nice that hardware software are little better than previous models but phones are overpriced glass on phone front back cause it to slide off of surfaces frequently make it difficult to hold in my hand prefer metal-backed phones because friction makes them easier to hold have dropped this phone many times have already cracked screen very glad didn pay for
screen,my mother got this for herself she wasn to fond of bigger screen so she got smaller version of she has been use to home button being physical button so this one has home button from iphone which has that taptic feedback home button which isn actual button just felt really weird for her but eventually got how it works now it not issue other than that she says it nice upgrade for iphone if you need to upgrade want smaller screen
screen,this is great option over iphone on paper it will be just as fast with smaller lower resolution screen lower price point it feels great to hold familiar which don mind would not upgrade if you have but if you are coming from it is worth it
screen,replaced my broken iphone 6s with iphone fast great display most of technology of iphone less available now
screen,iphone is premium feel great screen resolution

screen,nice step forward for iphone we didn buy iphone because it wasn big enough step forward maybe iphone because screen is awesome
screen,hard to tell photos apart from my cannon rebel great noticeable display gigs need say more great phone didnt think they would out do others but they did

battery,this is my first galaxy after being apple fanboy for years this is pretty much perfect phone it feels compact for having such big screen camera is great it has good battery
battery,phone it self is really nice has some really nice features loved iris scanner battery seemed to last nice amount for me but within first day of having it it would randomly restart it would happen about 6-10 times day got it swapped out with new phone it did same thing after taking it to samsung in local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it he did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it but no solution yet this seems to be common problem even though it not being widely reported on do search for galaxy s8 restarting it going on weeks since release no comment from samsung see samsung community boards people are calling samsung they are still telling them ve never heard of this ended up returning mine before days
battery,this phone is absolutely amazing looks good processes fast uses less battery life than it predecessor
battery,overall phone is ok however it seems to activate apps on it own when it is in my pocket it pocket dials lot even though have locked it before putting it in my pocket touchscreen on bottom instead of home button is bit of hassle know phone has many new features but battery life is disappointing if you have any real significant use
battery,phone is very good price was very good got it on sale at off plus got in trade for my old galaxy s5 very pleased with phone so far great design faster than my old phone plenty of storage battery is good there were couple of glitches some of my apps didn transfer from my old phone so had to download them again old phone voice mail didn get transferred to new phone had to spend quite bit of time with at to fix that also it still too time consuming too much paperwork to get new phone upgrade spent over two hours at best buy there should be way to streamline all that but it good product nice looking phone it got case screen protector those are little pricey for what they are but necessary would give phone four half stars if possible
battery,realize have hard time changing phones however this one is not user friendly had to turn off touch setting as phone is really sensitive swiping through screens frustrating battery drains very quickly definately not happy with this purchase have bit of time for first time in phone purchases am seriously thinking of returning it
battery,so far am enjoying this phone very much it is quick easy to use have already learned how to customize it to my liking this might seem easy to you but for year old that is not smartphone savvy think doing good have not used camera much yet but pictures have taken look very good still have to try upload something to fb one of these days transferring everything from old phone to this one was quite easy also was fortunate enough to have people at bestbuy do it for me when bought it but all they did was hook up cables it pretty much did work for them would say use my phone less than most younger people so my battery seems to last good while would usually be at battery with my galaxy but with this galaxy s8 lowest have seen my battery go down to is so to me that is big difference have not had any issues with calling with this phone although my wife also has same phone sometimes people have trouble hearing her but we are not sure if it is her phone theirs overall am very pleased with this phone but let see how it does in next months so
battery,love it great phone good battery life not to big
battery,wonderful phone great colors battery pretty good highly suggest
battery,this phone is beautiful slim you will love it when you saw it at first glimpse but os is kind disappointing if you install more apps you get higher chance of slow stack all kinds of problems battery drain out very quickly after using for few months now miss iphone
battery,phone is fast responsive great camera pics good battery life
battery,decided to upgrade to s8 after battery on my s6 drained so much so often battery life on s8 only requires me to charge my phone once per day hi love it it definitely worth upgrading for that reason alone
battery,pretty good phone coming from iphone romance ve had this phone for months struggling to find reason to stay pros camera resolution speed cons autocorrect poor battery life need to buy music
battery,screen is gorgeous battery is amazing this is dad one of best galaxy phones have ever owned
battery,great phone battery life is very good only complaint is bixby keeps popping up
battery,had been eyeing this phone among couple of others battery life screen quality etc finally made me decide on this phone best buy beat out any others by long shot for price
battery,great phone camera takes outstanding pictures battery lasts longer than most other phones
battery,purchased this phone for my dad great phone nice battery life awesome camera he loves it
battery,battery life on samsung s8 smartphone is great improvement over previous models as is camera find bixby feature bit annoying could probably do without it it certainly doesn have nearly capability of alexis sir overall s8 is good but probably overpriced product
battery,this is my 3rd galaxy series device as always this one has not disappointed at all excellent screen beauty to behold awesome camera quality in both outdoor low-light conditions battery life to last days with medium usage just wish that blue color had been around when bought this
battery,really nice phone good camera long battery life
battery,replaced older smartphone big jump in features find that battery life little better than old phone with caveat you need to put battery on mid power to last day going to assume there is just too many programs running in background sucking juice other than that it great phone screen is super clear
battery,constantly freezes so that you have to reset only to find your battery has drained by more than half
battery,display is excellent takes great pictures battery lasts long time
battery,this phone has great battery life is waterproof recently upgraded from samsung s6 edge easily could tell difference in battery life recommend this phone buying case soon as you purchase
battery,when my galaxy s5 started acting very sluggish started looking around online for reviews of newer model phones samsung galaxy line remained top in line in regards to what my needs wants were was back forth between s6 s7 s8 was not necessarily looking for newest model but after talking with sales rep in best buy store it was better deal to go with new s8 must say am extremely happy with my s8 buying experience am still finding new things that phone does every day features are pretty awesome display is amazing great battery life great phone
battery,like phone so far color is gorgeous still trying out new features great battery life so far
battery,nice slim phone excellent battery life takes great pictures sound is very clear
battery,screen audio speed battery etc all great upgraded from iphone first time android user so far loving it highly recommend

battery,had phone exactly weeks when it asked for update after update phone was dead before update my phone had over charge was working perfectly then after update it would not turn on show light when plugged in for charging spent minutes on phone with tech who had me hold down every combo of buttons possible nothing have never dropped my phone it was only weeks old essentially brand new according to many online posts this has been constant problem with new phone especially since you can no longer remove battery for hard reboot this is so disappointing have always raved about samsung products now my faith is shaken
battery,have spent lot of time finding out all featured of this phone love everything about it although not huge fan of curved screens find that they aren issue with this phone screen isn curved as much as previous edge phone it makes viewing photos videos very nice on this phone camera takes beautiful pictures videos sound on this device is also very good battery life is also really good only con of phone is trying to find glass screen protector for it that works so far have only found that zagg glass one works is case friendly
camera,love this phone phone itself is so beautiful screen is even better it feels like holding future upgraded from galaxy s6 thought would really miss physical home button but pressure sensitive home button on s8 is awesome don mind placement of fingerprint scanner can still reach it easily on back great front facing camera also phone comes with micro usb to usb adaptor so don even need to buy new car charger
camera,best phone ever very easy to use with every app gadjet available pictures video are awesome recently used it camping where there was no tv reception to watch netflix amazon youtube paired with screenbeam mini you can stream without wifi connection
camera,this is first time owning another phone that wasn iphone picked galaxy s8 because it had ear phone jack in addition to charging jack that apple removed from their newest phones at first it was hard to transition from iphone now having best camera ever with galaxy s8 now finding can post faster to facebook with one button options that iphone can compete with can add memory without having to rent cloud did say can add lots of memory that holds every photo apple never allows you to add memory with sd card apple always upgraded until your phone would not work anymore some due to memory issues not any more with galaxy s8
camera,former iphone only user dropped my iphone in river fishing last week now it just paper weight decided that someone like me active outdoors man should get phone that can handle elements galaxy s8 checked off all my needs waterproof rating is higher than iphone gorilla glass is stronger basically had dropped s8 in river last weekend would still have it not to mention it does almost everything better than iphone it has unbelievable display just sit watch 4k videos on youtube annoy my family showing them how amazing it is video camera is top notch too just love this phone bought uag case for it look it up now it even more dynomite will have this phone for long time
camera,new galaxy s8 met all of my expectations great camera easy to use
camera,big android person s8 is must beats iphone any day great pictures voice quality
camera,omg coolest phone ever awesome health features really enjoy taking pictures with it amazing camera enjoy also getting free beat buy points when write this review that at least needs to be freaking characters long in order for them to accept this as legit review hope this is enough
camera,what great phone beautiful screen incredible pictures lots of memory you can add up to gb card if you want to sleek design with edge lighting phone is slick literally get protective cover to help keep you from dropping it
camera,camera really is winner here in assignment for college our class had to record video my phone did things iphones couldn so we unanimously used samsung everyone was jealous

camera,my daughter loves this phone it has great camera highly recommend

camera,this device has way more features benefits than iphone only thing that makes iphone better is camera
camera,used to have s7 which always heats up have to remove case charge it because of that cannot take phones when charged have to use head phones but s8 doesn heat up it has great camera loved it
camera,have enjoyed quality of camera size of screen of my phone
camera,before this had samsung galaxy s5 which loved would have kept it but it got smashed use it for same purpose as s5 camera is slightly better but don use all new features
camera,this phone has so many features picture quality is amazing
camera,this is probably one of top phones of best display on smartphone amazing camera super fast great design build quality would recommend to anyone
camera,best cellphone ever made super fast picture quality is amazing
camera,purchased this s8 to replace s5 that had started acting up glad we did this is so much better to do things on than other we loved camera on my old phone but this is way above that one of course now has front facing camera also extremely happy with purchse best buy people were great helping me switch phones setting new one up
camera,smoothest function best camera greatest phone experience you can get bought it through best buy presale bestbuy associate transferred all data set it up for me in just few minutes love phone love best buy experience
camera,great phone easy to use outstanding picture quality
camera,purchased this phone for my 16-year old son he had been living with galaxy s4 for several years so he knew he wanted to stay with samsung this phone has all bells whistles clear pictures super fast processing he mostly texts youtubes listens to music no actually phone calling so can speak to all other features but he happy so happy
camera,am loving s8 size is perfect not too large while retaining large display fast smooth performance great camera wireless charging gorgeous display
camera,beautiful design great screen resolution rear camera doesn have dual lenses but still takes great pictures
camera,really can say there anything wrong with this phone other than bixby samsung siri interfaces are great camera awesome comfortable to hold work with but bixby is not really accurate with speak to text for me to point that get annoyed trying to use it
camera,wow this phone is thin it has crystal clear picture is very fast processing information works great on at network
camera,just got this phone week ago it works great love way it looks how slim it is it not huge difference from s8 but prefer it this size if you have s7 edge it definitely upgrade it slimmer looks like it years newer than s7 edge only thing is that setup fingerprint but it in back by camera so haven needed it yet overall great purchase
camera,was undecided of phone that wanted but love full screen camera on this device
camera,awesome phone with big screen great picture quality sound
camera,love my samsung galaxy s8 would recommend this phone to anyone great camera easy to use
screen,am very happy with new s8 it has been very easy to use hold would not go without case at all get screen protector protection plan asap
screen,awesome phone what else is there to say absolutely beautiful design stunning display packed with plenty of storage for most enough power to do anything you reasonably want phone to do
screen,it great phone just wish they wld do away with curved edge of phone because it seems pointless also makes it difficult to use good screen protectors phone cases
screen,phone is useful but it is not as agile as my s5 it is irritating that something that is made well is removed from market when upgrading occurs why not just update internals maintain already functional format curved screen is no big deal phone just another fad selling point my expectations are for amount of money spent want something strong functional don bother me me with foolish fads
screen,ve had this phone for few months now have found it very easy to use ve previously used lg also iphone like display on this better than both of those my one complaint though is how easily screen gets scratched recommend getting screen protector immediately let my husband talk me into waiting couple days in order to buy screen protector that was on sale online ended up with scratch on screen within couple hours of owning phone even though was very very careful still somehow got scratch that annoys me every time look at my phone
screen,great phone beautiful screen very useful slim agile
screen,always love my samsung products this is no exception went from s7 appreciate all updates only thing don like is not being able to find tempered glass screen protector that fits well ve finally given up on it
screen,it nice phone with good features wish they wld do away with curved edge it seems pointless also makes it difficult to use good screen protectors phone cases
screen,touch screen is sometimes hard to use do love canada speaker goes out though
screen,replaced my galaxy for this galaxy 8s some features are nice it was easy to learn new navigation system curved edge means have to use plastic screen guard instead of glass one plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils charging cable is shorter than on my galaxy s5 have dropped it times this week because of picking it up from charger cord is too short never dropped my galaxy s5 needs charging daily
screen,first smart phones for family easy to use large screen protective case highly recommended
screen,screen is amazing it is crazy fast does everything need
screen,nice phone still trying to adjust to this type of screen as it is very different than previous phones
screen,infinity screen is gorgeous for media consumption you can find no better current mobile option imo it is fast at all tasks slim design makes it much easier to handle in your hand
screen,there are lot of great aspect to this phone but it not as adaptable as other phones there certain things that you can change controlle that is more of annoyance with this phone for instance text dictionary normally when you try say one thing phone will auto correct it to what it thinks you were trying to say then when you change that specific word sentence there is way to add to dictionary but not on this phone this next sentence will be unaltered so you can see what taking about in whay way dies auto correct dies this its supposed to say in what way does auto correct does this so now your left repeating same mistakes over over again its annoying there should be way do add words to your dictionary so you don have to keep editing what you re trying to say there isn other thing that kinda annoys me is that they have all these hi-tech ways of opening your phone like retina recognition finger print voice activated etc but they don have most basic thing it annoys he ll out of me that double tap to open it does not exist on this phone they have list of ways to unlock your phone they are all really cool but just want basic to open my phone when its off shouldn be process just double tap screen to turn on pattern lock to open done there are other annoying things but won go into details about it reason giving this stars is because they do have great featureson this phone but texting does suck last sentence for this review unaltered had to changethe spelling on each sentence granger at least ten aspirate times before out period down have fin translating this
screen,display on this phone is incredible was blown away by how much screen they fit into phone no bigger than regular iphone super fast super responsive
screen,love my new samsung display graphics are amazing
screen,big screen but not too wide fits your hand perfectly is exelent cellphone not too big but huge screen for size price but bixby key is kind of annoying
screen,great design fits perfectly in my hand superb display was easy to transfer my data from 950xl excellent photos many features makes it pleasure to use multi window display capability is great
screen,works well touchy screen sides that switch it easily
screen,just have to watch when you get near side it flips screens
screen,it is nice phone have good speed display
screen,screen clarity is excellent noticed screen doesn show smudge marks like my old one
screen,ve owned used samsung phones including captivate note iphones 6s nokia lumia s8 so far has been best ve owned screen is amazing phone is responsive it just feels looks futuristic
screen,awesome screen must get good case because there are two glass on phone love unlocking with iris scan
screen,love size excellent quality all around nice big screen too
screen,daughter loves s8 loves screen likes thiness of it fits in her hand comfertabally she always has used samsung im pretty sure
screen,color is very bright nice it is balance between s8 s8 plus it is nice to have smaller unit in hand where finger can reach across screen when you try to type
screen,it looks nice not sold on curved screen really don get point it just makes it harder to put drop proof case on it would have kept s7
screen,nice design but hindered by bad operat8ng system great display though
screen,this phone has such pretty screen charges fast
screen,this is great improvement over my galaxy s5 faster more memory more storage brilliant display overall excellent phone
screen,am still learning this phone but do enjoy easy access security speed of it it has bright screen knows me in just week
processor,phone it self is really nice has some really nice features loved iris scanner battery seemed to last nice amount for me but within first day of having it it would randomly restart it would happen about 6-10 times day got it swapped out with new phone it did same thing after taking it to samsung in local best buy they could not find anything wrong so they flashed it he did say that in his system he saw that there were many reports of it but no solution yet this seems to be common problem even though it not being widely reported on do search for galaxy s8 restarting it going on weeks since release no comment from samsung see samsung community boards people are calling samsung they are still telling them ve never heard of this ended up returning mine before days
processor,galaxy s8 is fantastic phone it has powerful processor expandable memory is durable against elements only have to minor complaints about phone it super slippery phone is made completely of glass there is no plastic backing grip surface anywhere on phone so be prepared to buy necessary case just so you can hold onto phone bixby button bixby is most useless personal assistant application among all phones you will find yourself meaning to hit power button but wind up pressing bixby button which is right across from power button on accident which starts bixby app while you can turn off access to bixby app when you swipe right on phone app will always start when you click hardwired bixby button there is no way to disable this button functionality in phone best solution ve come up with is to buy case pop out case button that corresponds with bixby button so you cannot physically press it with bixby now out of my life my experience with phone is phenomenal highly recommend phone
processor,replaced my galaxy for this galaxy 8s some features are nice it was easy to learn new navigation system curved edge means have to use plastic screen guard instead of glass one plastic screen guard needs more frequent cleaning from skin oils charging cable is shorter than on my galaxy s5 have dropped it times this week because of picking it up from charger cord is too short never dropped my galaxy s5 needs charging daily
processor,have only had s8 for about week after migrating from s5 so im still getting used to it getting familiar with all features so can only give it stars at this point it might be star phone but just don know yet im still not sure what to think about bixby feature need to get more familiar with it to see if it is worthwhile not for my needs so far like phone just fine there definitely performance over s5 as there should be not knocking s5 but newer phones should perform better with more memory faster processors
processor,glad didn have to learn new system from my s6
processor,nice design but hindered by bad operat8ng system great display though
processor,love new operating system do enjoy larger no button screen
processor,definitely upgrade to my s6 edge in display memory processor evidently noticed right away beautiful display very responsive to touch still have to setup bixby but so far so good
processor,upgraded from samsung s4 to s8 absolutely love new phone bigger screen size longer battery life faster processor haven found anything don like about new phone yet
processor,has passed on s6 s7 so my s5 was definitely showing it age this phone rocks got it with included gear vr this phone can handle processing power required for smooth vr experience other than that it samsung so you probably already know what you re getting unless you need to stick with kiddie ecosystem of apple just get this phone
processor,great phone beautiful screen fast processor sleek design way overpriced though
processor,reviewed s8 prior to purchase it was all positive must mostly due to operating systems compatibility nothing at time talked about poor screen craftsmanship phone slipped out of my pocket as was lying on ground working on vehicle phone was in wallet case fall from few inches cracked screen damaged lcd my last three phones have been samsung galaxy repair will be near when parts are available was not offered protection plan if it was presented salesman pushed through it while talking to another salesman about photography may have to switch back to apple
processor,was nervous about not having button on front but hardly notice really like still having buttons on sides for volume control but phone is super sleek fits well in my hand it is operating great has great quality screen would definitely buy again
processor,so far am very pleased with my phone love display it way better than my old iphone it also came with lots of free stuff completely different operating system than apple but didn know much about ios anyway if going to have to learn new system anyway might as well be one that has nicer display more memory
processor,great phone that is compact yet has large screen with great clarity fast processor that does not lag when multi tasking great camera with professional effects screen clarity is unmatched by other phones on market only down side is that bixby button takes getting used to can be easy to hit with intending to change volume setting this is not feature use would be nice if this button could be re-purposed
processor,great camera beautiful display quick processor great phone
processor,great phone battery life is outstanding screen wow just wow s6 had great camera hard to grasp how they made s8 better going from s6 to s8 was simple samsung included smart switch in system apps to make things super easy did transfer via wifi when it was finished all my apps screens looked like they did on s6
processor,newest samsung smart phone with large screen fast processor
processor,would be great except that having fingerprint reader on back is awkward very inconvenient also its placement next to camera lens means that lens always has fingerprints on it constantly needs cleaning octicore processors are fast make for really smooth operation with minimal wait for responses
processor,great size feels good in hand fast processor takes great pictures has good battery life you can even see screen in bright day light
processor,while very apprehensive to leave apple ecosystem found transition very easy after aft android file transfer was loaded very happy with screen camera phone overall
processor,left iphone 6s plus got this phone great size actually smaller phone but same size of iphone 6s plus love screen operating system
processor,amazing brilliant phone samsung never disappoints know every company has its issues but so far that ve had this phone since 21st of april have no complaints processor is fast camera is amazing screen is beautiful plus it water resistant how better can it get def recommend to all samsung fans for first time android users
processor,pros amazing screen fast processor good functionality touch screen responsiveness edge feature is somewhat helpful cons fingerprint scanner location responsiveness camera bottom firing speaker

others,replaced my windows phone that had for so long due to it slipping out of my pocket from very high position ha man have been missing out for all these years difference between these two is crazy not big app user but still its crazy felt like just came out of middle ages granted never lived during middle ages did
others,great phone for great price with cool pre order bonus
others,phone is pretty cool it over heats when charging on wireless charger charged it as slept 12am-6am but cools instantly bixby sucks liked cortana when had my htc
others,bought this phone for my year old son he loves it more than any phone he had he had lots of phones it very lifeproof as he is very hard on his phones he also gamer he says this phone can handle any game that he puts on it
others,volume is excellent phone design is sleek slender fits well one hand for texting bixby is awesome to use
others,it does job but there are lot of glitches such as text notification not working it freezes at times
others,this is great phone would recommend this to world
others,have had my phone for months now absolutely love it upgraded from g5 haven had any regrets getting another samsung phone
others,samsung carrier locked phones are just worth year before they start getting slow would have preferred to buy unlocked phone instead of carrier locked but due to financing options with att had to stick with it just think twice before going for any samsung smartphones since they have tendency to slow down quickly carrier updates are generation old
others,love this product even better got it for price that couldnt be beat
others,we got this phone for my boy friend he really doesn care for it he has been having alot of issues with his it might be just him not doing needed up dates like did for plus
battery,ve had phone for nearly month now love it probably didn need to upgrade as my galaxy s5 was perfectly functional although seemed to be running slower not much of phone-tographer but cameras seem to be big improvement over s5 camera functions too feel more intuitive quicker im not huge fan of curved edges aside from allowing more comfort for hand edge feels more like gimmick than anything it essentially disappears once phone is in case which is almost necessity considering price understand some might find it annoying that fingerprint sensor is now on back of phone but haven yet gotten onboard with biosecurity technology still like my digit pin so can speak to iris scanner facial recognition either was worried about absence of tactile home button but it hasn been issue bixby like biosecurity is something haven found use for yet it exclusive button is very close to volume down button which can be mildly aggravating if you are relying on touch alone to minimize sound speaking of sound speaker is now on bottom of phone as opposed to back as someone who watches listens to good deal of media on my phone find this change from my s5 great improvement as for battery life ve been extremely satisfied so far was very happy with my s5 battery life find that my s8 lasts considerably longer am slightly nervous about not having access to my battery though over two half years used my s5 did have to remove battery handful of times to reset phone due to unresponsiveness glitches another improvement over s5 is lack of plastic back which made that phone feel cheap conversely higher end metal glass back of this phone make it feel incredibly fragile it too bad that something so sleek well-designed requires case to keep it from scratches scuffs cracks advertised infinity screen is non-existent with addition of even slimmest case lastly really like included headphones in comparison to those of s5 they are little more substantial in ear keeping them from popping out also allowing good deal of noise-cancellation cord feels to be made of sturdy metal mesh that comes off as rugged long-lasting
battery,switched from lg g5 phone is very fast so far my battery is lasting longer than day with lot of use left screen on which still looks great as someone else pointed out screen protectors are pain not just zagg one none of them seem to fit slight curve phone is fast looks amazing
battery,long time iphone user switching to far superior galaxy s8 battery life is great even in high performance mode super fast charging don feel like have to ration my battery make my phone wall phone
battery,have always been iphone person whenever ve strayed away from iphone ve always gone back to it after couple weeks but not this time samsung galaxy s8 is awesome coming from iphone plus it took little while to get used to narrowness of s8 but screen size is actually slightly bigger diagonally than iphone plus so didn feel need to get s8 size of this phone is perfect it fits so much better in pockets purses etc than iphone plus camera on s8 is stunning colors are true depth clarity are on point with improvements samsung has made to front-facing camera you don end up looking all distorted like on previous galaxy models s8 is fast not experiencing any lag when quickly switching between apps playing games battery is decent but iphone plus battery was better although it is nice to have couple different power-saving modes on s8 being able to customize everything on s8 is really great so is being able to have all kinds of widgets since last time had android phone years ago there have been so many improvements made to play store apps for apple android seem to basically be same now which is great also feel that am able to make my phone more secure with android as opposed to apple all in all happy with switch made to s8 from iphone
battery,have enjoyed using this phone so much that feel need to write one of my first online reviews my last two phones were iphone iphone enjoyed both very much only thing disliked about either was battery life neither of these phones lasted me full days use which often left me without phone late at night this was huge issue when was out late needed uber to contact friends was something wanted to avoid with my next phone purchase loved ios my iphone six was still working fine minus awful battery life after reading some reviews on iphone decided to look into android phones due to mediocre battery reviews s8 had good reviews for battery life although not best for verizon models moto play but it had best reviews for almost everything else which swayed me best buy also had deal going on when purchased it that made it same price per month as moto z2 play that made decision to buy it much easier user interface is easy to use highly customizable screen is amazing it comes with gigs of storage my last phone had so this was huge for me battery life is incredible ve tried it on two main battery settings high mid both lasted me at least full day my first day with high use heavy downloading on full power lasted me from 8a-1a with over left on mid battery saver mode it had over half battery left ve ended up around on full power since that first day all days referenced were around hours use my phone pretty heavily see biggest drops on apps like reddit groupme youtube phone also charges very quickly never could play games on my last two phones due to storage ve downloaded few including final fantasy all run very smoothly it kind of blowing my mind that one of my favorite playstation games can run so well on phone edge to edge display is as advertised it first thing that draws you in in-store pressure sensitive home button is great ve had no issues even when using glass screen protector finger print sensor is also located in place that apparently bothering many users but have case that makes it very easy to feel where it is so have no complaints went with clear otterbox symmetry because liked way orchid gray back of phone looks wouldn recommend purchasing one of tempered glass screen protectors they sell due to price love glass protectors because accident prone ve been using protector from amazon tempered glass protectors are all getting panned online but ve had no issues be really nervous using this phone without extra protection in regards to my purchasing experience best buy was great had only upgraded phones in verizon stores since my first phone in high school so going to best buy made me slightly wary associates were all incredibly helpful not pushy at all they actually talked me out of purchases was heavily considering s8 for extra battery very glad passed it was way too big in my hands it wouldn have been worth extra hour two of battery life wouldn end up needing was able to easily add phone on to my monthly plan just like at verizon only at half cost overall can imagine there better phone out right now it most unique fun user experience ve had since my first smart phone
battery,wasn planning on upgrading but price at bb was so great couldn help myself it has been great decision as had s7 this phone has awesome battery so fast love it
battery,have always owned android phone for as long as can remember tried apple iphone did try to give phone chance but it wasn for me went back to galaxy s8 couldn be happier am on my phone lot so love how long battery stays charged
battery,long battery life fast need case slippery in hands
battery,hadn upgraded my phone since galaxy s4 because features such as removable battery even upgraded storage had been taken out because my s4 still was working just fine even to this day only real reason upgraded was because of special deal going on with new s8 figured why not even though those two previously mentioned features are not in new phone it actually hasn impacted me like thought would much more improved battery lasts me few days without charging it leads me to believe it will last me quite while down road also going from 16gb storage to gb storage made me not even need extra sd card anyway interface runs very smoothly screen quality is fantastic it might not be worth going from s7 one up but if you re more than couple models back it worth it
battery,love this phone but aspect ratio is little weird when watching movie video with screen in landscape orientation there are vertical black bars on both edges of screen this is minor issue but it worth mentioning great battery life unlock features iris scan is really cool works surprisingly well
battery,read reviews before purchased this phone have to say that this is best phone out in my opinion ve had it for almost weeks now still learning new things battery life is amazing on this phone got body glove case but no screen protector as it really difficult to find one that works with curved screen case only things hate are curved screen size volume really wish samsung would have made flat screen made screen inches instead of inches because believe that sweet spot not too big not too small also wish samsung had provided louder speaker maybe duel speakers at bottom one in ear piece like iphone these are minor issues not enough to lose star over but just believe if these things were done it really would be perfect phone in my opinion
battery,was on fence between iphone samsung samsung clearly is better because android allows me to customize my phone to my needs battery life is great
battery,have to say that this phone has been good upgrade compared to other phones its not loud phone but its decent really like display battery life different features it has another good thing it has not frozen yet am still getting used to edge which makes it hard to find good screen protector for it overall its nice job done by samsung great deal with best buy
battery,extremely happy with this phone bought it on black friday deal offering off couldn be happier battery life of this phone is phenomenal am avid phone user social media snapchat texting spotify etc this battery lasts me hours this is first phone have ever owned that lasts me entirety of day even with how frequently use it screen is beautiful display is next-level extremely impressed so glad chose this over iphone got this phone after already owning galaxy best buy transferred everything from my old phone in minutes this phone is best purchase have made in long time
battery,great phone upgrade from s7 great battery life
battery,best looking phone out there great battery life amazing display performance
battery,ve looked at several devices from samsung this was one that made me jump being that it was perfect balance of screen size battery life internal memory performing better than advertised would purchase this again am quite happy with it
battery,love my new phone battery life is great pictures are awesome very easy to use
battery,this mobile phone is best one on market with all latest features before any other brand never had any problems with battery overheating dieing to soon plus if it did die you have access to inside your phone to change yourself
battery,my last samsung phone had been note really hated touch wiz some other annoying features have always pushed for better value phones but when this one was cheap enough didn have better option reluctantly bight s8 have been really happy touchwiz is no longer laggy phone looks great takes good pictures runs whatever need it to really push phone it battery still lasts fingerprint reader is annoyingly placed but have gotten used to it it is not issue only concern is bixbie button which can now disable but volume keys are now hard to reach not worth docking star though this really is great phone
battery,this phone is reliable battery almost always has lot of power beautiful pics from camera
battery,battery lasts at least day with moderate use phone is water resistant works well software is easy intuitive
battery,samsung galaxy s8 is very nice phone camera takes great photos battery life is very good had samsung galaxy s6 am very glad upgraded
battery,got rid of s6 terrible battery this phone alot same with many better things battery better but nit great
battery,great phone has nice camera battery life is good was just little bigger than
battery,excellent phone good battery life never lags
battery,fairly easy to use takes great pictures good battery life
battery,great battery life beautiful screen fast processing power are highlights of s8 samsung new personal assistant bixby takes bit of getting used to but it is incredibly valuable once you complete learning curve screen quality is most beautiful have seen on phone yet storage space 64gb is insane adding memory card makes it feel like you can have storage that won run out do miss physical home button that galaxy series has become known for though best buy exclusive blue color is nice light shade of blue that is understated but still sleek noticebale
battery,this was upgrade from galaxy s6 daughter loves phone great battery life sharp clear screen added bonus is that best buy gave us nice-sized gift card for trading in old phone even though it was on it last leg
battery,this is best samsung galaxy yet love larger screen battery lasts forever you will not be sorry if you get this phone
battery,very dependable good battery life can use portable charger
battery,so far so good great features great size still fits in pocket awesome battery life
battery,great phone so far long battery life user friendly
camera,camera is great phone apps are easy to work with loving it better than my iphone 6s
camera,so was really excited to get this phone it looks great it fast call clarity is superb screen size is amazing camera is top notch but screen has already cracked phone has not been dropped yet like to think take good care of it noticed small spec in screen one afternoon it got worse over next few days now it runs up down entire screen honestly have no idea what did to make this happen guess now am stuck with it for more months luckily none of functionality seems lost so am still enjoying it for most part
camera,decided time price were right to upgrade from my galaxy s5 which had for about three years to s8 overall am pleased with it compared to s5 s8 is thinner narrower made of slick shiny guerrilla glass this might be good for smaller hands to hold but for me this phone required case for better grip so after week of use decided to purchase urban armor gear monarch case which provides right amount of width grip as well protection still fits in my pocket without being bulky picture is bright clear even on lowest setting external speaker at bottom of phone sounds surprisingly good too you just have to remember not to keep your hand over it you ll muffle sound of course you could also use enclosed earbuds provided by akg your own as this phone has headphone jack calls ve made so far have come in loud clear use retina scan to unlock phone it works very well so far also plan to get fast charge pad but for now using fast charge cord it came with just few suggestions for best buy have few sample cases at display table so customers can compare feel of phone both with without case found out my best buy credit card is not supported on samsung pay android pay even though it has citi logo called samsung pay help desk was told card was not supported because it was issued by best buy rather than citi so am hoping best buy can lobby for all its credit card members to get best buy credit card included with samsung pay android pay know would use that app
camera,when samsung announced coral blue color my wife just had to have it what great upgrade for s6 superfast gorgeous screen wireless charging is awesome camera head shoulders above s6 may get s8 for myself
camera,this was upgrade from s4 transfer of contacts done in store was incomplete but app found easily transferred all contacts from s4 to s8 camera has some cool features notification sounds are all different than previous phone so there is learning curve love blue color
camera,great phone with super camera amazing display but you will have no problem at all using it with one hand very recommended
camera,phone is easy to use great camera light in weight
camera,so far have really liked phone upgraded from s7 it has been good transition was concerned about phone being too bulky but its pretty much same size other than height infinity screen curved edges make it hard for cases to fit just right but at least there is lifeproof for it otherwise phone is great it is super fast camera is incredible it almost freaked me out how hd recording is if were to change anything on phone it would be bixby button bixby itself it seems like waste of button space on my phone rather button start google assistant
camera,great camera great video great low light performance lots more storage than my previous 16gb phone love that can add micro sd card curved screen is gimmick that don find that useful but curved screen makes it very difficult to get good screen protector that doesn interfere with touch screen doesn fall off doesn peel up when swiping from edge have had to restart it few times when encounter glitches that make phone hang otherwise phone is great
camera,am loving this new phone camera on both front back are exceptional call quality is great love look feel of this phone screen is just awesome love all new security features on this phone
camera,phone is easy to use great camera clean pictures applications easier to use
camera,this phone has amazing camera takes some of best pictures ever absolutely love this phone
camera,my samsung galaxy purchase exceeded my expectations there are so many features that even after months continue to learn new things about my phone camera is amazing my photo are best have ever taken with cellphone
camera,coral blue color is stunning exclusive to best buy fans of samsung products android phones will not be disappointed in quality of phone in performance camera imaging functionality apple users this phone will make you want to convert
camera,this phone does it all it looks great with it slick form factor there no lag when use it camera is great there ton of shortcuts with hard buttons everything is pretty seamless there nothing you can do with hard button for bixby being there but at least there are apps to change its use have no complaints camera is top notch
camera,s8 is very good cell phone camera takes nice pictures display is sharp clear accessing web pages is rapid having many sites open at same time is no problem my main complaint is that when button keyboard character displays at edge of screen trying to get item to display may require several touches due to curvature of screen edge of screen is good for display purposes but awkward for input
camera,enjoy my galaxy phone but camera is hard to work with protective case over it my internet signal is worse than my galaxy
camera,upgraded to s8 from s5 with no hesitation once knew phone had qualcomm chip it was between s8 sony xperia premium s8 had slim profile better screen to body ratio screen resolution was not deal changer since it just phone not tv great quality phone that fast have been using face recognition with back up pin to unlock phone face recognition doesn register as often as like to trouble shoot this go change your picture in unlock settings to common position you typically gold to unlock your phone recommend playing with your picture as you ll see when phone takes it but overall great buy interested in bixby release
camera,well was on edge of giving up on android as whole after horrible experience with galaxy s7 edge told myself was going back to apple however s8 managed to get my attention am glad it did because it is best phone you can get on android it hardly ever slows down hardware like camera is amazing
camera,overall phone was good upgrade it is easy to use camera works well
camera,love this new phone screen is larger camera works really well what don like about is new usb port had to buy new car charger for my phone
camera,camera video quality is best out there love love my samsung
camera,eyelike how fast camera takes pictures screen all of apps that are added on
camera,samsung is simply best new galaxy takes amazing pictures is very quick responsive this phone does everything more it seems like all other companies are trying to play catch up with samsung technology
camera,this phone is great fast user friendly good camera
camera,great phone with great camera screen is awesome had to go with liquid screen protector because nothing glass fits curved screen very well so far so good
camera,samsung galaxy s8 is step above any phone great camera great features easy to use
camera,this was first phone ever got on launch day it beautiful perfectly sized great screen great camera very durable this phone will last me years at very least
camera,this is best samsung phone that have bought in last ten years it is easy to use camera takes clear photos
camera,very nice phone great on screen picture camera
camera,upgraded from s5 basically same as s5 with few improvements camera takes fantastic pictures
camera,this samsung phone is excellent phone it is superior in every way to all of iphones have owned in past photos are of excellent quality picture goes all way to curved edge of screen on phone price paid was also much less than any of iphones offered at time of purchase
camera,great screen clarity camera takes excellent pictures ease of using icons love it
screen,this phone is awesome no matter what way you put it design is freakin beautiful awesome screen thin it fast everything yoou want in smartphone well worth money
screen,very nice phone it latest flagship phone from samsung it does not disappoint screen is beautiful performance is snappy usb-c port is convenience importantly to me new samsung s8 s8 support video-out via usb-c port you need to buy usb-c to hdmi adapter separately though
screen,as always galaxy s8 is step forward for mobile technology though some of choices they made are rather bizarre what do admire is new super amoled display which works well in almost any lighting situation without manually adjusting your brightness also like other typical things like external memory good screen size 4k resolution unfortunately as mentioned previously there are few things not totally comfortable with for instance edge screen has been nuisance while attempting to type until had to turn it off bixby commands are way too easy to trigger for example if you re trying to adjust volume of something your finger slips you turn bixby on swipe left on your home screen too much bixby turns on don get me wrong like bixby just wish that it wasn so intrusive finally for one of my biggest gripes they changed aspect ratio of phone you see instead of expanding in both dimensions galaxy s8 decided to expand only vertically while this means that it can better fit in places like cup holders pants pockets it also means that they changed aspect ratio to wouldn have as much of issue with this if more things were integrated with that lot of apps are stuck in changing that could break application this means that of screen is wasted on black space this is something hope they go back on with galaxy s9 overall think that galaxy s8 is just okay which is bad for samsung
screen,phone is beautiful sleek even some of typical bloatware is uninstallable s8 so far is fabulous with plenty of awesome new features tweaks that being said below is link to top of line screen protector that best buy stocks for s8 do not buy this screen protector read reviews you won regret it http www bestbuy com site zagg-invisibleshield glass-curve screen-protector for-samsung galaxy-s8 transparent skuid
screen,really enjoy phone wish there was option for no edge screen cracked screen in first two weeks thank goodness it still works because geek squad insurance says can get replacement yet one month so far with shattered screen being held together with screen protector
screen,galaxy s8 is beautiful phone with few flaws that consumers should be made aware of fingerprint sensor is not in ideal location however it works great for accessing notification menu curved glass also causes screen protectors to not it here to surface very well also big-selling point is bixby but it is not functioning as promised
screen,this phone is easy to use looks sleek has amazing screen is several times more powerful than apples new phone apple will probably have this tech on market in about years charge for it you could get all that now at fraction of price
screen,this is my 3rd phone from galaxy line s3 s6 were my 1st 2nd even though first two were perfectly fine performed well this one far out does them it taking me some getting used to not having actual physical home button to get to home screen default location of chrome shortcut button happens to be exactly where my apps button is on my s6 these aren negatives at all edge seems fine although really haven looked at it much yet bixby button function is well placed but haven looked at it much yet either best buy employee was great samsung representative in best buy store was great there are actual official samsung repair centers in select best buy stores didn know this until after purchased my phone so while not negative web site could do better job of letting people browsing samsung devices know that there is such option with that new information in mind decided to switch my phone protection to geek squad plan instead of one offered by my carrier hope never need to use it but am content that can go to best buy store to take care of it excellent phone excellent customer service by both best buy employee samsung representative excellent protection plan option excellent best buy incentive my carrier had none except if traded in my old phone which didn want to do
screen,liked my phone is overall smooth sturdy but little knock on curved side of screen caused it to crack wish had it cover protected on day one
screen,great upgrade from my s5 which has been feeling slow clunky nice slim phone awesome screen lots of new features
screen,this is great phone but curved edges are not asset buttons near edges are tricky to push due to curve options for covers to protect phone are also limited due to curved screen require glass screen protector which makes keys less sensitive cover that does not come up around edge of screen to protect it in case of fall
screen,this phone is fast has huge memory looks great with curved edges it takes while to get used to fact that there no physical home button but on-screen button works just as well if you hold that area where button for 1-2 seconds while screen is off it turns on screen just like it would with physical home button great product overall
screen,still learning all new features no problems at this point other than curved screen doesn take glass protector shield very well will look at flexible plastic protector to see if it any better
screen,this product has very few noticeable changes from s7 except now it has curved screen wasn really in favor of this feature my s7 was great phone assume this will be too time will tell
screen,beautiful feels nice performs well so far it is still new but it is very nice we are quite pleased with it so far speedy very nice display feels great
screen,nice phone curved screen is great for pics but bit of pain to put screen protector on inductive charging is great too great upgrade to older galaxy models
screen,known fragility issues screens case are cracking with without dropping with protective cases screen protectors do your research have always loved galaxy phones but this one is different buyer beware
screen,loved phone more features than could handle phone was little narrow for my liking coming from s5 display was nice sharp overall phone was really nice to use had it for about days before returned it only down side to phone was charging adapter phone does not use standard samsung charging connection but instead you have to use tiny adapter on all your cords that is only reason gave it four out of five stars returned it for s7 edge
screen,love style color also full screen edge to edge
screen,samsung s8 is thing of beauty great design feel in hand screen is awesome phone is super fast
screen,phone is great easy to use load apps screen is large enough to see but not too big to put in pocket
screen,great phone had s6 passed buying s7 bought this one instead glad waited great phone clear screen easy to navigate
screen,screen size great for watching video hard to use with one hand good photos
screen,great phone love screen size never had problem with android phoness
screen,my wife recently upgraded our galaxy s5 to s8 phone is overall nice improvement one gripe so far is both of our s8 phones don deal well with glass screen protectors screen sensitivity is greatly reduced with glass type protector so much so that ended up removing my glass screen protector our s5 both had glass screen protector without issue upon doing some research we are not only ones with this issue on s8
screen,this phone is best iteration of galaxy series could take leave curved edges but speed performance clarity of this phone are spectacular add in water resistance expandable memory headphone jack always-on info display you have great phone
screen,this phone case has good protection but makes touchscreen little difficult
screen,beautiful design display is best ive seen from smart phone cant complain
screen,love phone itself android version on it is extremely easy to use very stable only complaint have is that screen is very easy to crack curved edges make it necessary to have phone case so you are not accidentally pressing things on side of your screen all time
screen,smoothest fastest os ve felt on phone batter lasts full day on one charge screen is like butter
screen,always been android fan had nexus 6p decided to upgrade to galaxy s8 but it wasn upgrade love phone design style features but just don think it will be as reliable bullet proof as nexus 6p was have only had galaxy s8 for months it seems to be getting worse with issues phone freezes randomly during various things occasionally it will unfreeze but times out of it requires me to force soft reset by holding volume down power button to force restart have done full factory reset times replaced external sd card ran it without sd card no change ran it factory stock with no apps installed it may freeze up trying to open pandora it may freeze up after call stay stuck in call screen not even allowing you to answer calls back from person it just dropped call from samsung has built in app for help but expert help suggests all stuff have already tried next step is to send it back to samsung for replacement which would leave me without phone that not viable solution right now since run business android oreo is supposed to be out in next couple months really hope it fixes whatever issue is happening if not have to bite bullet send it start from scratch again ps nexus 6p got passed down to my son he managed to drop it twice crack screen dump class of soda on it it still running strong not missing beat
screen,best phone have ever had dropped twice with case cracked screen both times samsung is fixing over local quotes to fix over
screen,s8 is my first android phone have been iphone user for past years was getting sick of apple way of being best but not really wanted something new change of pace s8 was phone was looking for display is stunning phone has multitude of capabilities however there are few shortfalls to phone first is that android technology does not incorporate percentage indicator for bluetooth devices while this may seem picky one does not like their headphones dieing on them in middle of great workout secondly bluetooth is not what it cracked up to be my iphone had much longer range for its bluetooth could play my wireless speaker in basement while standing on my first floor it would be clear s8 breaks up as soon as go to second floor overall great phone but needs some improvement
processor,gs8 is very nice premium feeling phone with awesome edge to edge display android operating system runs very smooth camera quality is also quite good

processor,started looking to upgrade my phone earlier this year checked out some of moto lg options at time all so huge bulky decided to wait for galaxy s8 so glad did phone is incredibly sleek comfortable similar feel but overall huge upgrade from my old moto x2 camera is spectacular has newest processor android version so runs like dream definitely beats lg g6 still have difficulty finding fingerprint sensor placing my finger just right not best design placement next to camera would have preferred below centered but honestly retina recognition for unlocking works incredibly well even in varying light conditions through glasses contacts etc still waiting hoping for additional bixby features but overall excellent phone with very few downsides
